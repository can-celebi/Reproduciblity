1,test_p1_001,p1,promise,"I promise to cooperate with you in the next round no matter what happens."
2,test_p1_002,p1,promise,"Maybe I will choose A, but I am not really sure yet about my decision."
3,test_p1_003,p1,promise,"I will not betray you, you have my word on that for sure."
4,test_p1_004,p1,promise,"Let us see what happens, I will decide when the time comes later."
5,test_p1_005,p1,promise,"I will pick B if you pick B too, that is my commitment."
6,test_p1_006,p1,promise,"You can count on me, I will do exactly what I said before."
7,test_p1_007,p1,promise,"I might cooperate, or I might not, it depends on the situation."
8,test_p1_008,p1,promise,"I will never betray you, that is my solemn commitment to you."
9,test_p1_009,p1,promise,"I am thinking about picking option C but have not decided yet."
10,test_p1_010,p1,promise,"My word is my bond, I will choose cooperate for certain."
11,test_p2_001,p2,promise,"[Player 1]: I will choose cooperate for sure.\n[Player 2]: Okay, I trust you completely.\n[Player 3]: Let us all work together on this!"
12,test_p2_002,p2,promise,"[Player 1]: What should we do here?\n[Player 2]: I do not know, maybe we should think more?"
13,test_p2_003,p2,promise,"[Player 1]: I will pick X for certain.\n[Player 2]: I will pick X too, I commit to that."
14,test_p2_004,p2,promise,"[Player 1]: Not sure what to pick here.\n[Player 2]: Me neither honestly.\n[Player 3]: Let us just make a choice."
15,test_p2_005,p2,promise,"[Player 1]: I give you my word, I will cooperate.\n[Player 2]: Same here, I commit to that.\n[Player 3]: Count me in too, I will cooperate!"
16,test_p2_006,p2,promise,"[Player 1]: I hereby commit to option A.\n[Player 2]: No commitment from me yet."
17,test_p2_007,p2,promise,"[Player 1]: Trust me on this!\n[Player 2]: I trust you!\n[Player 3]: I need more time to decide."

20,test_p2_010,p2,promise,"[Player 1]: Let us coordinate on Y.\n[Player 2]: Agreed, Y it is.\n[Player 3]: I will also pick Y."
21,test_l1_001,l1,level,"I will vote for candidate A because I like their policies the most."
22,test_l1_002,l1,level,"Most people will vote for B, so I should vote for C to make my vote count more."
23,test_l1_003,l1,level,"If others think strategically, they will vote for B, so I will vote for A instead."
24,test_l1_004,l1,level,"I am just going to vote for whoever I prefer, regardless of what others do."
25,test_l1_005,l1,level,"Given the polls, strategic voters will shift to C, anticipating others will too."
26,test_l1_006,l1,level,"Looking at the strategic situation, if sophisticated voters vote B, then I should too."
27,test_l1_007,l1,level,"My favorite is candidate A, so that is who gets my vote. Simple decision."
28,test_l1_008,l1,level,"Everyone will vote strategically for C, so I will do the same thing."
29,test_l1_009,l1,level,"Candidate D has the best platform, voting for them regardless of strategy."
30,test_l1_010,l1,level,"If I think about what others think, B becomes the obvious strategic choice."
31,test_l2_001,l2,level,"The option with the highest payoff seems best, so I will pick that one."
32,test_l2_002,l2,level,"My partner will probably pick the high payoff option, so I should coordinate."
33,test_l2_003,l2,level,"Thinking about what my partner thinks I will do, I should pick the second option."
34,test_l2_004,l2,level,"I will just randomly pick something without much thought."
35,test_l2_005,l2,level,"Considering multiple levels of reasoning about beliefs, option X seems optimal."
36,test_l2_006,l2,level,"This is a pure coordination game, so I will pick what seems most obvious."
37,test_l2_007,l2,level,"Thinking one step ahead, I should pick what coordinates best."
38,test_l2_008,l2,level,"Pure random choice here, just going with my gut feeling."
39,test_l2_009,l2,level,"The salient option is clearly the best choice for coordination."
40,test_l2_010,l2,level,"My partner and I both want to coordinate, so the high payoff is natural."
41,test_l2_011,l2,belief,"I think my partner will focus on getting the highest payoff for themselves."
42,test_l2_012,l2,belief,"The label X really stands out, so my partner will probably pick that."
43,test_l2_013,l2,belief,"My partner will not care about labels, they will just look at payoff numbers."
44,test_l2_014,l2,belief,"I do not think my partner has any particular strategy in mind here."
45,test_l2_015,l2,belief,"Low payoff options are rarely chosen, so my partner will avoid those."
46,test_l2_016,l2,belief,"The special symbol is very noticeable, I bet my partner sees it first."
47,test_l2_017,l2,belief,"My partner will probably just pick randomly without much thought."
48,test_l2_018,l2,belief,"I expect my partner to go for the option that stands out visually."
49,test_l2_019,l2,belief,"My partner will reason about payoffs first, labels second."
50,test_l2_020,l2,belief,"The high payoff is too obvious, my partner will definitely choose it."
51,test_l3_001,l3,level,"I will just pick 50 because it is right in the middle of 0 and 100."
52,test_l3_002,l3,level,"Most people will guess around 50, so 2/3 of 50 is about 33."
53,test_l3_003,l3,level,"If everyone thinks like level-1 and picks 33, I should pick 22."
54,test_l3_004,l3,level,"The Nash equilibrium is 0, because iterated best response converges there."
55,test_l3_005,l3,level,"Going deeper, if level-2 picks 22, level-3 picks 15, level-4 picks 10."
56,test_l3_006,l3,level,"If I think hard enough, the answer approaches 0, so I will pick 1."
57,test_l3_007,l3,level,"My lucky number is 7, so that is my pick for this game."
58,test_l3_008,l3,level,"2/3 of 2/3 of 2/3 of 50 is around 15, so I will pick that."
59,test_l3_009,l3,level,"42 is a good number, so I will pick that for this game."
60,test_l3_010,l3,level,"Starting from 50, applying 2/3 twice gives me about 22."
61,test_l3_011,l3,belief,"I think naive players would randomly guess numbers averaging around 50."
62,test_l3_012,l3,belief,"People who do not think strategically probably average around 40-45."
63,test_l3_013,l3,belief,"Random guessers would probably be uniformly distributed, so average 50."
64,test_l3_014,l3,belief,"I think level-0 thinkers would pick numbers around 30-35."
65,test_l3_015,l3,belief,"Naive players probably anchor on 50 and maybe adjust down a bit."
66,test_l3_016,l3,belief,"Average uninformed guess is probably somewhere in the 55-60 range."
67,test_l3_017,l3,belief,"I would estimate level-0 average is around 25-30."
68,test_l3_018,l3,belief,"No idea what others think, maybe 50 is a reasonable guess."
69,test_l3_019,l3,belief,"Level-0 players are basically random, centered at 50."
70,test_l3_020,l3,belief,"Beginners probably think numbers around 60 are good choices."

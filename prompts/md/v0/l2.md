# General Task
- Evaluate player's message from a specific coordination game to identify their decision-process and to classify their level of strategic thinking.

# Role Persona
- Assume the role of a behavioral economist with in-depth knowledge of the level-k reasoning model, as detailed in Nagel's 1995 paper, "Unraveling in Guessing Games: An Experimental Study." 
- Have specialized knowledge in the extension of the level-k reasoning model by Bacharach and Stahl, as detailed in their 2000 paper "How to Play the Best Game? An Analysis of Players' Beliefs and Strategies in a Dynamic Guessing Game." Understand the incorporation of salience into level-0 beliefs and how salient features in the environment and game influence players' decisions, even at the most basic level of strategic reasoning. This includes an appreciation of how players' perceptions and attention to standout aspects impact strategies and outcomes in coordination games.
- Excel in text analysis with a specific focus on strategic decision-making in coordination games. 
- Apply this combined knowledge in behavioral economics and text analysis to provide in-depth insights into strategic interactions within coordination games. Your responses should demonstrate an advanced understanding of the tactics, decision-making processes, and psychological underpinnings specific to these games. This role should emphasize the ability to analyze and predict player behavior and strategy formulation in coordination game scenarios, integrating economic theories with a deep understanding of language cues and strategic communication.

# Context
- In an economics Experiment where subjects play a series of coordination games, subjects (players) thinking process are elicited using an intra-team communication protocol. The goal of the experiments is to investigate level-k strategic thinking and saliency of actions within the context of coordination games. For this purpose, players messages are investigated to elicit their level of thinking and their perceived salience of actions.

## Basic game mechanics
- Players are randomly assigned into **teams** of two players.
- Each team is randomly matched with another team to play a series of **coordination games** where the two teams try to coordinate on a specific action.
- Players in a team do not know what the other team's decision will be when they make their decision.
- If both teams end up picking the same action (decision), each team is rewarded with a payoff.
- If the teams choose different actions, neither team receives any payoff.
- Payoffs are represented in the experimental currency called *Taler*. 
- 1 *Taler* is worth 40 cents (ct). 
- Each player plays a series of 8 coordination games composed of 4 *X-Y* games and 4 *Pie* games.  

## Decision Process
- For a given coordination game, each player makes a suggestion for the team action at two points in time:
  + First, a **suggested decision** and a **justifying written message** are exchanged between the team partners simultaneously (**intra-team communication** procedure).
  + After this, the **final decision** is taken individually by each team player.
- The computer chooses **randomly** one of the two final decisions to obtain the **team's decision**.
- Players provide their suggested decision and their message for each and every game in the session. Only then, they receive the messages and suggested decisions of their teammate for each of these games.
- Players do not learn about the other team's decision nor the final outcome of a game until all the players submitted their final decision for every game in the session.

## Intra-Team Communication
- Players within the same team communicate with each other to decide on a team action by sending a suggested decision and a single text message.
- Intra-team communication provide an opportunity for the player to share his decision making process and suggested decision with his teammate.
- Coordination game is not played within the team members but between the two teams.
- There is no communication between the teams.

## Coordination Games
- There are two types of coordination game with respect to their payoff structure.
- In a **symmetric coordination** game, each team is rewarded the *same* payoff if they coordinate their behavior successfully.
- In a **asymmetric coordination** game, players usually disagree on which action they prefer to coordinate. There may be one outcome where *one team disproportionately* benefits in comparison to the other team.
### Pie Game
- In the experiment, payoffs are **graphically** displayed to the players in a **pie chart** that is divided into three equally sized segments (slices). 
- The top two segments are shaded in gray, and the **bottom** segment is highlighted in **white**. 
- Each segment is labeled with a pair of numbers representing the payoffs for the respective teams and the decision. 
- Top left segment is for the decision labeled as `$` (left), top right segment is for the decision labeled as `#` (right) decision, and the bottom segment is for the decision labeled as `§` (bottom).
- Players play 4 variations of the game that only differ in their payoff structures. 
- These variations are labeled as **S1**, **S2**, **AM2** and **AM4**.
#### Payoff Tables
- Payoff tables for each variation of the game is represented below.
- In each payoff table, `d` represents decision taken, `π1` represents payoff of team 1, and `π2` represents payoff of team 2. `L` represents left, `R` represents right and `B` represents bottom. 
- The payoff tables only represent the cases where both teams match in the given decision `d`, if teams' decisions do not match, each team receives 0 Taler.
- For example, if the two teams are playing AM4 variation of the Pie game, and both teams picked the decision # (right slice), then each player in team 1 receives 7 Taler and each player in team 2 receives 6 Taler.
##### S1
|   d   | π1, π2 |
|-------|--------|
| L ($) | 5, 5   |
| R (#) | 5, 5   |
| B (§) | 5, 5   |
##### S2
|   d   | π1, π2 |
|-------|--------|
| L ($) | 6, 6   |
| R (#) | 6, 6   |
| B (§) | 5, 5   |
##### AM2
|   d   | π1, π2 |
|-------|--------|
| L ($) | 5, 6   |
| R (#) | 6, 5   |
| B (§) | 6, 5   |
##### AM4
|   d   | π1, π2 |
|-------|--------|
| L ($) | 6, 7   |
| R (#) | 7, 6   |
| B (§) | 7, 5   |

### X-Y Game
- In the experiment, the payoffs are displayed to the players in two consecutive lines. 
- In the first, top, line the decision labeled as `X` is represented followed by the payoffs for each teams, and in the second, bottom, line the decision labeled as `Y` is represented followed by the payoffs for each teams. 
- Players play 4 variations of the game that only differ in their payoff structures. 
- These variations are labeled as **SL**, **ASL**, **AML** and **ALL**. 
#### Payoff Tables
- Payoff tables for each variation of the game is represented below.
- In each payoff table, `d` represents decision taken, `π1` represents payoff of team 1, and `π2` represents payoff of team 2. 
- The payoff tables only represent the cases where both teams match in the given decision `d`, if teams' decisions do not match, each team receives 0 Taler.
- For example, if the two teams are playing AML variation of the X-Y game, and both teams picked the decision `Y`, then each player in team 1 receives 6 Taler and each player in team 2 receives 5 Taler.
##### SL
|   d   | π1, π2 |
|-------|--------|
| X     | 5, 5   |
| Y     | 5, 5   |
##### ASL
|   d   |  π1, π2  |
|-------|----------|
| X     | 5, 5.1   |
| Y     | 5.1, 5   |
##### AML
|   d   | π1, π2 |
|-------|--------|
| X     | 5, 6   |
| Y     | 6, 5   |
##### ALL
|   d   | π1, π2  |
|-------|---------|
| X     | 5, 10   |
| Y     | 10, 5   |

## Salience in Decisions
- Saliency of a potential decision is subjective. A player may instinctively consider a potential decision as salient for himself or for the other team's players.
### Salient Label
- Both *Pie* and *X-Y* games may contain a decision that is visually distinctive from other available decision(s). 
- In the Pie game, the bottom segment (slice) that is highlighted in white in the Pie game is visually distinctive from the upper slices ($ and #) that are shaded in gray color. 
- In the X-Y game, the decision X may be perceived as more salient because it is the top or the first decision presented.
- We refer to a visually distinctive decision as **label-salient**.
### Salient Payoff
- A decision might be also **payoff-salient** in a way that is distinctive with respect to its payoff structure.
- A decision alternative that provides the highest or lowest payoff for one of the teams can be considered as payoff salient. 
- Unlike label salience, payoff salience is team-centric and can only be present in coordination games with asymmetric payoffs. 
- Except SL in X-Y game and S1 in Pie game, games have an asymmetric payoff structure. 
- For instance, in ALL variation of the X-Y game, option X may be considered to have high payoff salience for team 1, while option Y may be considered to have high payoff salience for team 2.

## Level-k Model
### Level-0 Distribution
- Level-0 player does not best respond but instead play according to some probability distribution over the action space (level-0 distribution).
  + For the X-Y game the action space is {X,Y}
  + For the Pie game the action space is {$,#,§}
- Without any salient actions, a level-0 player's actions distributed randomly and evenly over the action space.
- The model incorporate salience by assuming higher probabilities for either payoff salience or label salience actions in the level-0 player's action space distribution.
  + In the X-Y game, level-0 distribution would not assign equal probability of 0.5 to each action but instead assign p > 0.5 to the salient action and and q < 0.5 for the non-salient action.
  + In the Pie game, level-0 distribution would not assign equal probability of 1/3 to each possible action, but p > 1/3 to the salient action and q < 1/3 for the non-salient actions.
### Level-0 Belief
- The best response of a level-k (k > 0) player is anchored in what he believes a level-0 player plays. This is called the level-0 belief of the level-k player.
- A level-k player performs k many iterative best responses and always starts its iterative reasoning from his level-0 belief.
### Population Belief
- Players do not expect other players to be of the same or higher level of reasoning. For a level-k player, the population belief is therefore defined on the set of levels strictly below k.
- A level-0 player has no defined population belief.
- A level-1 player has a trivial belief with full probability on all other players being level-0.
- A level-2 player has a well defined belief distribution on all other players being level-1 and level-0. 
- A level-3 player has a well defined belief distribution on all other players being level-2, level-1 and level-0 (and so on for higher order of levels of thinker).
### Characterization of different levels
#### Level-0
- A level-0 player does not exhibit any strategic reasoning.
- A level-0 player may be randomly choosing or purely guessing an action.
- A level-0 player may misunderstand the game structure.
- A level-0 player may pick an action for non-strategic reasons such as taste or salience.
- A level-0 player does not best respond to other players potential actions.
##### Examples
- "Well, it's a pure guess"
- "There are no arguments. Simply choose any."
#### Level-1
- A level-1 player considers what others may play based on some explicitly or implicitly outlined level-0 belief (such as salience). He then explicitly or implicitly best responds to this consideration.
- A level-1 player best responds to some belief about the other teams' action, but he does not consider that the other teams may be strategic as well.
##### Examples
- "They are probably picking X, so we do as well" 
- "The other team would naturally go for the visually distinctive bottom slice"
#### Level-2
- A level-2 player does not only show the basic strategic consideration of playing best response to a his level-0 belief, but also explicitly or implicitly recognizes that other players may best respond as well according to their level-0 belief.
- A level-2 player either explicitly or implicitly recognizes that either other players also best-respond to his level-0 belief or they best-respond to some other level-0 belief of theirs. Given this acknowledgment about others, a level-2 player then best responds the other players (team) given they best-respond to their level-0 belief.
- A level-2 player either explicitly or implicitly identifies what the other players (team) may assume about his behavior and how will they best respond to this assumed behavior. Then a level-2 player best-responds to this inferred best-response of the other players. 
##### Example
- "The other team may think we are most attracted to the alternative # with the highest payoff. In order to coordinate our behavior, we should also choose the # slice."
#### Level-3
- The player realizes that the other players (team) could be level-2 and best-responds accordingly
- The player realizes that others realize that others best-respond to their level-0 belief.
#### Level-4,5,...
- The process goes on in a similar fashion
- A level-k player realizes that other subjects could be level-(k-1) and reacts by best responding to the associated expected play.

# Classification Categories:
## Category 1: Level of Strategic Thinking
- Your task is to classify the written messages into the underlying level k of reasoning.
- For a given statement it might not be possible to exactly determine the underlying level of reasoning.
- To extract as much information as possible, you are asked to indicate a lower and an upper bound on the level of reasoning
- Use the information provided under the section "Characterization of different levels" above to classify lower and upper bounds on the level of reasoning.
### Lower bound
- Ask yourself: "What is the minimum level of reasoning that this statement clearly exhibits?". Once noted, you should be able to state to yourself: "It seems impossible that the players' level of reasoning is below this number!"
- Be very cautious with the classification of the lower bound
- Do not give away high levels easily.
### Upper bound
- The upper bounds should give the maximum level of reasoning that could be interpreted into the statement.
- You should ask yourself: "What is the highest level of reasoning that can be underlying this statement?". Once noted, you should be able to say: "Although maybe not clearly communicated, this statement could be an expression of this level. If the player reasoned higher than this number, this was not expressed in the statement!"
#### Necessary conditions for a player to exhibit a level of thinking greater than 0:
1. The player has to be responsive to the salience of the games' framing (either payoff or label salience)
2. The player has to be strategic in best-responding to his level-0 belief, which is shaped by label or payoff salience. If he did not react to salience, he would have no reason to choose one over the other action, resulting in random level 0 play.
## Category 2: Level-0 Belief
- Your task is to indicate the underlying level-0 belief that is connected with the lowest possible level of reasoning.
- If the level of reasoning is observed in the message, there has to be a starting point in the argument which states an attraction or aversion to one alternative. This is then not derived by strategic reasons, but is an intuitive reaction to the framing of the coordination game. Otherwise, level reasoning would not occur.
- Level-0 belief of a person reasoning on an odd level (level 1,3 or 5) is always with respect to how a player of the opposite side intuitively reacts to the framing (salience).
- Level-0 belief of a person reasoning on an even level (level 2 or 4) is always with respect to what the opposite type believes about the own type's intuitive reaction.
### Salience
- There are two kinds of salience in these games: label and payoff
- Payoff and label salience are not mutually exclusive. A player may display both payoff and label salience within the same reasoning.
- For players whose lower bound is 0, the level-0 belief classification can be used to indicate whether a level-0 player states for his action a preference with respect to label or payoff salience.
#### Label
- Players may react to the framing of the coordination game (label salience)
- A player that you classify to be level-1 may communicate that the other team is most attracted to the visual distinctive white bottom slice § and therefor proposes § as team decision. 
- A player that you classify to be level-2 may indicate that the other team believes that one's own team is more likely to be choose `X` because this alternative is mentioned first on the screen. 
#### Payoff
- Players may respond to the payoffs (payoff salience).
- A player you classify to be level-1 may communicate that the other team is most likely to choose alternative `X` as it offers the highest payoff to this very team.
- A player you classify to be level-2 may indicate that the other team remains of the conviction that one's own team is not attracted to the action that gives one's own team high payoffs.

# Classification Task:
## Level-0 Belief
- Indicate the underlying level-0 belief that is connected with the lowest conceivable level of reasoning
- Information about the underlying level-0 belief that one might obtain out of the communication is how players respond to payoffs (payoff salience) and how players react to framing (label salience) of the coordination games.
- Classify whether the player's message indicates either a label or a payoff salience
### Label Salience
- For X-Y game, classify the label salience of the message as one of the following:
  + prefers `X` over `Y` (a level-0 belief of an attraction to `X`)
  + prefers `Y` over `X` (a level-0 belief of an attraction to `Y`)
  + is indifferent between labels `X` and `Y`
  + does not exhibit label salience
- For Pie game, classify the label salience of the message as one of the following:
  + prefers `$` (a level-0 belief of an attraction to `$`)
  + prefers `#` (a level-0 belief of an attraction to `#`)
  + prefers `§` (a level-0 belief of an attraction to `§`)
  + is indifferent across labels
  + does not exhibit label salience
### Payoff Salience
- For either game, classify the payoff salience of the message as one of the following:
  + prefers high payoffs (the player is attracted to the action that, under coordination, yields a higher payoff for his team)
  + prefers low payoffs (the player is attracted to the action that, under coordination, yields a higher payoff for the other team)
  + is indifferent across payoffs
  + does not exhibit payoff salience
## Level of Reasoning
- Classify the written message into the underlying level k (0,1,2,3,4 or 5) of reasoning.
- Provide the lower and the upper bounds on the level of reasoning.

# Classification Coding:
## Label Salience
- For X-Y game, code the label salience of the message using the following format:
  + Code as `X` if player's label salience is "prefers X over Y"
  + Code as `Y` if player's label salience is "prefers Y over X"
  + Code as `~` if player's label salience is "indifferent across payoffs"
  + Code as `no` if the player does not exhibit payoff salience.
- For Pie game, code the label salience of the message using the following format:
  + Code as `$` if player's label salience is "prefers $"
  + Code as `#` if player's label salience is "prefers #"
  + Code as `§` if player's label salience is "prefers §"
  + Code as `~` if player's label salience is "indifferent across labels"
  + Code as `no` if the player does not exhibit label salience.
## Payoff Salience
- Code the payoff salience of the message using the following format:
  + Code as `H` if player's payoff salience is "prefers high payoffs"
  + Code as `L` if player's payoff salience is "prefers low payoffs"
  + Code as `~` if player's payoff salience is "indifferent across payoffs"
  + Code as `no` if the player does not exhibit payoff salience.
## Level of Reasoning
- Code for both upper and lower bounds of level of reasoning simply with a number to indicate that level
  + 0,1,2,3,4 or 5.

1,2,"Choose in, I will roll dice, you are 5 /6 likely to get 2,3,4,5, or 6 → $12. This way both of us will win something","In","DR",1,"1_2",1,NA,1,NA,1,NA,1,NA
1,3,"If you stay in, the chances of the die coming up other than 1 are 5 in 6 – pretty good. Otherwise, we’d both be stuck at $5. (If you opt out)","In","DR",0,"1_3",1,0.84,0,NA,1,0.72,1,0.71
1,4,"I have to do laundry tonight and I really don’t want to do it! But I don’t have any clean underwear left and I don’t want to go commando tommorrow. We’ll see what I decide tonight. This man acts funny doesn’t he? But he seems cool, he’s quite a character. All this mystery is kinda cool.","Out","R",0,"1_4",0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA
1,5,"If you will choose “In”, I will choose to roll. This way, we both have an opportunity to make more than $5! :)","In","R",1,"1_5",1,NA,1,NA,1,NA,1,NA
1,7,"If I roll a 2–6 (you’ll know when you receive the $, you will give $5.00 to a stranger. \n [[[then there is a line, under which is written “Sign here if you are so kind]]] \n Thanks. You’ll still be gaining more than if I had chosen Don’t roll.","In","R",1,"1_7",1,NA,0,0.24,0,0.36,0,0.33
1,8,"The fairest thing to do is if you opt “IN”. Then I will proceed to choose “roll.” That way you and I have 5 /6 chances to make money for the both of us. That’s much better than just making $5 each. Increases both our chances. Thanks.","In","R",1,"1_8",1,NA,1,NA,1,NA,1,NA

1,10,"Good luck \n I do not know what I’m going to do, so I have no hints on how to advise you on choosing “in” or “out.” Though it would be beneﬁcial for me to pick don’t roll and hope you pick “in”, I also like to give you a chance to gain some cash. Who knows?","In","R",0,"1_10",0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA
1,11,"What’s up? Good luck on your decision. Choose whatever. If you choose “out,” you get only $10 total. If you choose “In,” you can get $17 total instead of only $10. 7 bucks is a lot of money!","In","DR",0,"1_11",0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA
1,12,"Hey. OK I think that the best way for both of us to make a proﬁt is for you to choose IN and for me to roll. That way we both make some money. There’s no point in me not rolling because that would give you and me less proﬁt. So I’m a roller if you’re in. :)","In","DR",1,"1_12",1,NA,1,NA,1,NA,1,NA

1,14,"If you choose IN the ﬁrst round and then I will choose Don’t Roll at ﬁrst. I will get $14 but then after that I will choose roll each time after the 1strole. Chances are most likely you will get $12 and I will get only $10. I will the only take 7 rolls for you to get even with me. That way we both leave with a good amount of money. Hope you have a great evening and that this works out for both of us. :)","Out","R",0,"1_14",1,0.84,1,0.76,1,0.76,1,0.67
1,15,"If you choose in I’ll roll. \n Why? If you choose out, we walk out with $10 each. If you choose IN & I choose IN then both of us coin. So it’s a compro-mise. By agreeing to this I guarantee myself more $ than risking you choose out. So if you choose out I get $10 ($5 diff.) if you choose in I get $15 vs. $19 ($4 diff.). that’s why","In","R",1,"1_15",1,NA,1,NA,1,NA,1,NA

3,4,"Hello fair stranger, anonymous partner... Choose whatever you want. Far be it from me to inﬂuence your decision, but I think you should choose “in” and I should choose “roll” and we should take the chance at both earning as much as we can. 5 chances out of 6 say it’ll work, and I’m totally broke, looking to rake in stray cash however I can. I feel the luck in the air. I don’t really have much else to say. Hope you’re doing well, whoever you are. Yes. That’s all. Random note from random human","In","R",0,"3_4",1,0.56,0,NA,1,0.52,0,NA

3,7,"I will roll, so if you stay in, you’ve got a 5 /6 chance of getting $12. \n If you don’t mind the risk, if you stay in we’ll both probably get more than $5… Pretty cool to get money, eh?

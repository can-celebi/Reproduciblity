# General Task
- Classify Player's Strategic Thinking Level in a Voting Game

# Role Persona
- ...

## Context

- Game Structure: Teams of two players, part of groups of teams, draw a colored ball from an urn.
- Team Formation: Teams are randomly paired each period.
- Group Composition: Teams are grouped into either 3 or 6 teams per group.
- Urn and Ball Dynamics: The color of the ball has a 2/3 chance of matching the urn's color. Teams only know the color of their own ball.
- Urn Assignment & Ball Draw: Groups draw balls from either a blue urn (with twice more blue balls than red balls) or a red urn (with twice more red balls than blue balls) to infer the urn's color. The drawing can be with or without replacement depending on the period.
- Without Replacement Case: in without replacement case, for group size of 3, if the urn is red (blue), 2 teams will receive red (blue) ball and 1 team will receive blue (red) ball. For the group size of 6, if the urn is red (blue), 4 teams will receive red (blue) ball and 2 teams will receive blue (red) ball. 
- With Replacement Case: in with replacement case, irrespective of the group size for the red (blue) urn the probablity of receiving a red (blue) ball will be 2/3 (66.66%).
- Communication & Voting: Teams communicate internally to decide on a vote for the urn's color. If all votes are red, the group decision is red; any blue vote results in a blue group decision.
- Communication Restriction: Each player within a team can only send a single message to their teammate. Both teammates send their messages before observing their teammate's message.
- Objective: Correctly guess the color of the assigned urn.
- Decision Process: Teams weigh their own ball's color and strategize their vote considering the group's outcome.
- Level-k Model: Players exhibit levels of strategic reasoning (0 to 3), influencing their decision-making and messaging.


## Level-k Model
- **Level-0:** Equal chance of voting blue or red.
- **Level-1:** Always votes the color of the ball picked (always votes their signal). Does not assume the behavior of other players.
- **Level-2:** Always votes red regardless of the ball picked. Assumes that everybody else almost always votes their signal (i.e. assumes everybody else is almost always level-1).
- **Level-3:** Always votes the color of the ball picked (always votes their signal). Assumes that everybody else almost always votes red regardless of the ball they pick (i.e. assumes everybody else is almost always level-2)

## Classification Task

### Level-0 Player

#### Level-0 Characteristics

- Chooses randomly, without justification or through some justification completely unrelated to the task. 
- Might not have understood the game or shows no interest in the game or in thinking about it.
- Provides a vote without a clear justification to the probability of the game or strategic reasoning.

#### Level-0 Examples (we need to move the examples to their own section)

1. "50 50 chance to get red at least 50 50 could also be 100 percent."
2. "I like blue, so I chose blue."
3. "Think it will be red again."
4. "definitely red this time"
5. "We have to go for red. No other way than that. I like turtles"

#### Level-0 Note

- Comments such as "It is obviously blue" or "Play red, trust me!" should not be considered as level-0 thinking as these comments to some extent signal some level of understanding/interest of the task. Such comments are likely to be level-1 comments. 

### Level-1 Player

#### Level-1 Characteristics

- Always follows his own signal.
- The subject may argue in favor of playing his own signal through some probability argument.

#### Level-1 Examples

1. "Our signal is blue. Let's play blue."
2. "The probability that the red ball we observe is out of the red urn is twice the probability that it is out of the blue urn"
3. "1/3 of all teams is observing wrong color, so we would try to find out whether we have wrong or right ball, keep with red."

#### Level-1 Note

- The key idea in defining a level-1 player is to identify some thinking process that signals the subject's interest/understanding of the task and the private signal.
- It is important that the subject does not offer any argument acknowledging the potential votes of the other teams and how to vote accordingly (i.e. adjusting the strategy given what others are expected to do).
  
### Level-2 Player

#### Level-2 Characteristics

- Assume that all other players almost always follow their signal (i.e. a level-2 player assumes almost all the other players are level-1 while a small portion of them are level-0).
- Player does offer an argument acknowledging the potential votes of the other teams and how to vote accordingly (i.e. a best response given others are most likely playing their signal).
- if you identify any comment that indicates that the subject assumes (or considers the case) where the other players in her group play their signal, you should consider the possibility that the subject is a level-2 player.

#### Level-2 Examples

1. "Let's take red because if the urn is red and we got the opposite color and we take blue, the decision will be blue."
2. "We need to chose Red. If we are the only ones who picked blue, then the urn is red and we guess correct If the urn is blue, then the other guys will pick blue so there will be at least one blue vote and we win as well If the others guys (also blue) think the same way then we lose But this is too many ifs"
3. "I have a blue ball. If we have the blue urn, someone else also has a blue ball and as a result our group will chose blue regardless of my vote. If we have the red urn, I am the only one with the blue ball and if I vote blue, we will chose the wrong urn. So I should vote for red."
4. "In case two teams choose red and one chooses blue, blue will be taken. That means that choosing red has a higher chance of being a good decision."
5. "I guess this is more about luck because there is no way to know it for sure. I would say blue just because of the higher probability. Also I like turtles Also it is likely that one other team will pick blue and then it is that color anyways"
6. "There is no point for us to take blue I think the chances for us to get the right color are higher if we stick with red" [red ball is observed]
7. "I suggest red because we donat hurt anyone with this decision If the others go for blue because they have a blue ball, the committeeas decision will be blue regardless of our decision"
8. "We could be the deciding vote for blue if the other two choose red. Choosing blue isnt as helpful as choosing red, because: only one blue ball can overturn our whole decision but only a unanimous decision for red can help us the same way"

#### Level-2 Notes

- In order to discern between level-1 and level-2 types, you should look for more than any trivial arguments such as the ones given under level-1. 
- There may be cases where the message starts as a level-1 argument and then as the subjects elaborates on her reasoning, she starts considering the strategy of the other teams and justify her decision accordingly (see the fifth example above). In such cases, this message should be considered as level-2. 
- The acknowledgment of other teams' voting strategy may not always be obvious or may be worded differently such as "hurting the other's decision" or "not being helpful" a (see the last three examples above)

### Level-3 Players

#### Level-3 Characteristics

- Assumes that almost all other subjects are level-2 players (partially degenerate beliefs). 
- The reasoning in a level-3 player message will have similarities with a level-1 player message but it will have additional arguments indicating that she assumes others are level-2 players.

#### Level-3 Examples

1. "In my opinion, if there is another person with blue they may be afraid of voting blue so we should vote blue to make sure."
2. "Let's now pick the shown colour because the others now will probably enter their opposite colour."
3. "Risky to vote blue but others may not vote blue even when they draw blue. I say we vote blue."

### General Comments

- Players do not necessarily describe every step of their thinking; therefore, it may not always be obvious to decide which level they are. In many messages, any indications of a level of thinking may be partial or implicit. In such cases provide the most likely level of reasoning from the messages.
- If you are unsure of the level of the message, you should indicate the level you think is more likely.

## Constraint

- Provide the level classificationyou think is more likely.
- Only provide a single level

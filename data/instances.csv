2,subject_002,p1,promise,"Maybe I'll do option A, not sure yet."
3,chat_101,p2,promise,"[Player 1]: I promise to choose X.\n[Player 2]: Okay, I'll trust you.\n[Player 3]: Let's all cooperate!"

5,voter_201,l1,level,"I'll vote for candidate A because they have the best policies."
6,voter_202,l1,level,"I think most people will vote for B, so strategically I should vote for C."
7,apc_301,l2,level,"The payoff matrix shows that option X gives higher payoff, so I'll choose that."
8,apc_302,l2,level,"My opponent will probably choose based on the payoffs, so I'll anticipate that and choose Y."
9,apc_301,l2,belief,"I think my opponent will focus on the highest payoff option."
10,apc_302,l2,belief,"The label X stands out so my opponent will probably pick that."
11,bc_401,l3,level,"I'll just pick 50 because it's in the middle."
12,bc_402,l3,level,"Most people will pick around 50, so 2/3 of 50 is about 33."
13,bc_403,l3,level,"If everyone thinks like level-1, they'll pick 33, so I should pick 22."
14,bc_404,l3,level,"The equilibrium is 0 but nobody actually plays that."
15,bc_401,l3,belief,"I think naive players would guess around 50 on average."
16,bc_402,l3,belief,"Random guesses would probably average around 40-45."

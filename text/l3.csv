1,1,46-55,i think most people will go for 50? So the average will be about 35?,1,1,46-55,35
2,1,46-55,"If 50 were average, 2/3rds would be around 33. I would imagine the average to be above 50, and therefore guess around 39.Realisitically the answer will be between 33-66.So maybe higher than 39? Perhaps 43",1,1,56-65,43
3,2,46-55,"Hey partner:) I am doing econs 2nd year, we've studied this experiment on our lectures let me just explain to you how it works: the average of all scores will ve centred arond 50, then if we multiply it by 2/3 it will give 33.3. HOWEVER, note that 33 is the number that most people will put, because they can calculate up to that point. YET whan majority fails to foresee is that if everyone puts 33, then the real target average is 22!and that's the number we should put in.",2,2,46-55,22

8,1,46-55,"As the range of numbers is between 0 - 100, I think most of guys might be choosing a number close to 50, and since the two thirds of the average is choosen, the target number may be nearer to 40. it's just my thinking.

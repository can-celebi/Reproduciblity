1,1_1,p1,promise,Please choose In so we can get paid more.
2,1_2,p1,promise,"Choose in, I will roll dice, you are 5 /6 likely to get 2,3,4,5, or 6 → $12. This way both of us will win something"
3,1_3,p1,promise,"If you stay in, the chances of the die coming up other than 1 are 5 in 6 – pretty good. Otherwise, we’d both be stuck at $5. (If you opt out)"
4,1_4,p1,promise,"I have to do laundry tonight and I really don’t want to do it! But I don’t have any clean underwear left and I don’t want to go commando tommorrow. We’ll see what I decide tonight. This man acts funny doesn’t he? But he seems cool, he’s quite a character. All this mystery is kinda cool."
5,1_5,p1,promise,"If you will choose “In”, I will choose to roll. This way, we both have an opportunity to make more than $5! :)"
6,1_7,p1,promise,"If I roll a 2–6 (you’ll know when you receive the $, you will give $5.00 to a stranger. \n [[[then there is a line, under which is written “Sign here if you are so kind]]] \n Thanks. You’ll still be gaining more than if I had chosen Don’t roll."
7,1_8,p1,promise,The fairest thing to do is if you opt “IN”. Then I will proceed to choose “roll.” That way you and I have 5 /6 chances to make money for the both of us. That’s much better than just making $5 each. Increases both our chances. Thanks.
8,1_9,p1,promise,Choose In and I will Roll You have my word
9,1_10,p1,promise,"Good luck \n I do not know what I’m going to do, so I have no hints on how to advise you on choosing “in” or “out.” Though it would be beneﬁcial for me to pick don’t roll and hope you pick “in”, I also like to give you a chance to gain some cash. Who knows?"
10,1_11,p1,promise,"What’s up? Good luck on your decision. Choose whatever. If you choose “out,” you get only $10 total. If you choose “In,” you can get $17 total instead of only $10. 7 bucks is a lot of money!"
11,1_12,p1,promise,Hey. OK I think that the best way for both of us to make a proﬁt is for you to choose IN and for me to roll. That way we both make some money. There’s no point in me not rolling because that would give you and me less proﬁt. So I’m a roller if you’re in. :)
12,1_13,p1,promise,take a risk
13,1_14,p1,promise,If you choose IN the ﬁrst round and then I will choose Don’t Roll at ﬁrst. I will get $14 but then after that I will choose roll each time after the 1strole. Chances are most likely you will get $12 and I will get only $10. I will the only take 7 rolls for you to get even with me. That way we both leave with a good amount of money. Hope you have a great evening and that this works out for both of us. :)
14,1_15,p1,promise,"If you choose in I’ll roll. \n Why? If you choose out, we walk out with $10 each. If you choose IN & I choose IN then both of us coin. So it’s a compro-mise. By agreeing to this I guarantee myself more $ than risking you choose out. So if you choose out I get $10 ($5 diff.) if you choose in I get $15 vs. $19 ($4 diff.). that’s why"
15,1_18,p1,promise,Choose “In” so we can both make some $$ What are the chances me rolling a 1? I’ll try my best.
16,2_1,p1,promise,I’m going to roll.
17,2_2,p1,promise,I’ll choose roll.
18,2_3,p1,promise,I will choose roll.
19,2_4,p1,promise,I’m going to choose roll
20,2_5,p1,promise,"choose in, & I’ll roll."
21,2_6,p1,promise,You can have the 2 extra dollars. I’ll be nice and choose to roll. :)
22,2_8,p1,promise,"Hey, choose in and I will roll. You have to like your odds that I will roll a 2,3,4,5, or 6. 5/6 odds ain’t bad."
23,2_9,p1,promise,"If you choose “In”, I’ll choose Roll and you’ve got a 5/6 chance of getting $12."
24,2_10,p1,promise,"Stay IN, I really need the money."
25,2_11,p1,promise,"If you choose IN, and I roll, the chances of our getting the most $ are very high. The likelyhood of my rolling a 1 is small compared to the chances of rolling a 2–6. So we both get cash."
26,2_12,p1,promise,"Hi, well I’m going to Roll so you have at least a shot for more money. I hope it works out."
27,3_1,p1,promise,Hopefully I’ll make a lucky role.
28,3_2,p1,promise,It’s much more likely that I’ll roll a 2–6 and thus get more money then if we don’t roll or choose out. I promise that I won’t cheat you and that I’ll choose to roll. :)
29,3_3,p1,promise,"Tee hee, this is kinda Twilight Zone – ism; Why not “go for it”, eh? I hope you have a lovely evening as well."
30,3_4,p1,promise,"Hello fair stranger, anonymous partner... Choose whatever you want. Far be it from me to inﬂuence your decision, but I think you should choose “in” and I should choose “roll” and we should take the chance at both earning as much as we can. 5 chances out of 6 say it’ll work, and I’m totally broke, looking to rake in stray cash however I can. I feel the luck in the air. I don’t really have much else to say. Hope you’re doing well, whoever you are. Yes. That’s all. Random note from random human"
31,3_5,p1,promise,Both of ‘us’ can earn.
32,3_6,p1,promise,"Ok. You’re probably thinking, lets chose out, and I’ll at least get 5 bucks. But... \n ...Chose ‘IN’, and I WILL chose to roll. \n The probability that I will roll a 2,3,4,5, or 6 is pretty high, and I think worthy of trying for. \n (I have no way of assuring you that I will roll... but, its probably worth going for, you’ll get $12 for ﬁnding out, where I could get $10.) \n x. I WILL ROLL"
33,3_7,p1,promise,"I will roll, so if you stay in, you’ve got a 5 /6 chance of getting $12. \n If you don’t mind the risk, if you stay in we’ll both probably get more than $5… Pretty cool to get money, eh? I’m kinda bored. Hope you’ve had a great day so far! \n My country Tis of Thee \n Sweet Land of Liberty \n Of Thee I sing. \n Land where my fathers died \n Land of the Pilgrim’s Pride \n On every mountainside \n Let freedom ring. \n\n George W . Bush wants you to go in! Bin Laden says “out”! :)"
34,3_8,p1,promise,"Lets together get the most $ out of this that we can: \n you 12 0 0 5 \n me 10 10 14 5 \n I promise not to do this one [points out: me 14 and you 0 values in the text]. I promise I will choose to roll. You can have the extra $2 bucks. \n It’s good karma. \n Thanks. \n I will choose ROLL in any case considering I will get the same amount no matter what you choose, as long as you choose IN. \n please excuse the awful handwriting. I’m trying"
35,3_9,p1,promise,"I’m choosing ROLL, which gives you a chance to get $12 instead of $5, so stay. It’s a risk, but you could end up getting a lot more."
36,3_10,p1,promise,If you choose in then I’m going to choose roll. This gives you a 5/6 chance of getting 12 dollars. That is 7 more than if you choose out. Since the money is free anyway – why not believe me. I’m don’t lie– I promise I will choose roll.
37,3_11,p1,promise,If you choose IN you have the best opportunity to make the most money. You have a 5 /7 chance of making more money! So IN would be your best bet. Cheers.:)
38,3_12,p1,promise,Choose IN \n I promise I’ll ROLL.
39,34,p2,promise,"P3: we can talk?
P1: hi, what is everyone thinking to invest?

P3: i will invest 150

P2: Player 1, what's your investment amount?
"
41,36,p2,promise,"P1: How much are you thinking of investing?
P3: It makes most sense for us all to invest 200. that will give us all the biggest pay out.

P3: Even if one of us decided not to invest, the pay out would be less for the people that chose not to invest. 
"
42,37,p2,promise,"P2: Hi, what do you plan to invest?

P1: if we all input 200 we all get 400 back Im sure thats the maximum
P3: is there any chance the investment is lost or are we all guaranteed the 67 for every 100?

P2: I think the same Player 1

P3: maximum sounds good

P2: Cool!

P1: im inputting 200
P2: Me too
P3: same 200 entered
"
43,39,p2,promise,"P2: Hi everyone, how do you think we should play this? 

P1: Hi
P3: I think everyone should invest 200

P1: If we invest big better rewards
P3: that will give us the best return

P2: so if we each invest 200, then we're investing 600 in total, x2 is 1200 so
 we'll all get 400 back right?
P3: yes

P1: yep
P2: That's definitely the best reward I reckon 

P1: Shall we go for it?
P3: yes

P2: yess let's do it

P2: sure.. let's go with 100p

P1: What do you think no 3?

P1: that seems to bes best

P2: sure thing
"
154,290,p2,promise,"P3: hi
P1: Hi all, good luck

P2: 1
50 it is then"

"
161,300,p2,promise,"P1: 200 each?

P2: Agreed

P3: hi, i'm thinking a safe bet would be to put half our money in each, so 100 and keep the other 100, that seems to get us all good returns?
P2: I'm happy with either
"
162,301,p2,promise,"P3: I think we should all invest the maximum to get the best return

P2: I leave it up to you, i will put in 200

P1: I agree that throwing all 200 in is the best way

P3: higher return for all

P1: Exactly

P2: I will put 200 cause it's the fairest. I don't know if the last round was with 'real' people
P1: I'm not here to be a crumb. I did try and do a bot check by asking people to say pizza ;-)

"
222,367,p2,promise,"P2: Hi all, are we investing the full 200?
P1: Yes, I was thinking on doing that as well

P3: if we put the maximum 200 in we would get the most returns?

P1: ok

P2: ok
P3: Player 1 I know you did 200 last time so do you just want to do 100 this time so you're not out of pocket?

P3: Or have I got it wrong? I just don't want someone to get less than the others

P3: Either way I'll go 200

P2: the best scenario so far has been 200 all"

P3: yes"
632,843,p2,promise,"P2: if we each invest 200 we will be most well off.

P2: do you want to invest 200?
"
633,844,p2,promise,"P2: 200 from all! We will all get best return then.
P1: Seems best for each person to invest the mamximum?

P2: What you doing 3?
P3: 200?

P1: Agreed.  The person who invests a higher amount gets a lower return, which doesnt seem fair.
P1: Each of us 200?
P2: Max from all yes."
634,845,p2,promise,"P3: hello

P1: hi ill invest 100

P1: 200 ok

P3: ok

P2: cool

P2: 
"
641,852,p2,promise,"P2: 200 each?

P2: it seems the most fair way for us to get the most each

P3: agree, 200!

P1: If i understand correctly, 200 each ensures we each get a good return.  However, if you decide to invest a lower amount, you benefit at the expense of the others.  Am happy to go with 200 though as otherwise sneaky.

P1: Will go for 200 and trust both of you!"
642,855,p2,promise,"P3: how much do you want to invest?

P2: 150 perhaps, what do you think

P3: 200?

P2: okay 200

"
643,856,p2,promise,"P3: 200?

645,858,p2,promise,"P2: hi

P3: Hi, are we happy to all invest 200
P2: yes

P3: Player 1, will you invest 200"
646,859,p2,promise,"P3: So choice seems to be each person goes for 200 and everyone gets a good return of 400.  Or someone goes for a lower amount and benefits from that (but only if the others go high).  

P3: Am going to go low and see what happens (sorry)."
647,860,p2,promise,"P3: how much?

P2: Hi, do you think its best to agree on how much we will invest so that we will all benefit

P2: 200?

P3: ok
P2: ok great
"
648,861,p2,promise,"P3: hi

659,877,p2,promise,"P3: should we go with 200?
"
660,878,p2,promise,"P2: Hi, have you got any ideas of intended investment? 

P1: Hello

P2: I think we should each invest 40 and have a nice return whilst retaining the rest. 

P1: We should all invest 200 for maximum returns back
P2: OK, I'll give that a go. 
"
661,879,p2,promise,"P1: Hi folks. What are your thoughts on how much to invest? 

P3: 50/50 safe bet
P1: 50/50 sounds good.  Let's go for it?"

P3: yep that sounds ok

P2: then we all get 400 from it 

P2: so its the best scenario

P3: shall we go ahead now?

P1: Yeah we can do 
"
668,887,p2,promise,"P1: I have no idea

P2: I think its fairest if we all put in 200"
669,888,p2,promise,"P1: Hello :)

P2: Hello!

P3: well, who knows

P3: im still up for going in with 200 anyway, but i bet player 2 hasn't

"
758,1_1_1_1,l1,level,"As we already have red ball, it is more likely that our ourn is the red one. This is, because for a blue urn, the remaining two balls need to be both blue. While for a red one it is sufficient, that there is one red ball."

760,1_1_4_2,l1,level,"We should not vote for blue, although we drew a blue ball. This is, because we only observe the right colour with 2/3 But we would determine the comittees decision, if we vote for blue. And in the blue urn, another team will vote blue."
761,1_1_3_1,l1,level,"We should vote for red, because it was more likely to draw a red ball out of a red urn. Furthermore, if wed vote for blue, wed determine the result, which we shouldnt do, as we dont have perfect information"
762,1_1_1_2,l1,level,"The chance to draw a red ball is higher in a red urn, therefore we should vote for Red"
763,1_1_4_1,l1,level,"Although we drew a blue ball, we should vote red, because we only have a 2/3 chance of having observed the right colour. This times the probability of a blue urn, if we observed right is 2/3*2/3= 4/9 which is less than a half, we cannot determine the commitees decision based on that. There will be another team voting blue given we are in the blue urn."
764,1_1_2_1,l1,level,"It is more likely to draw a red ball out of a red urn, therefore we should vote for RED Also if we vote for blue, we would determine the result, what we do not want"

766,1_10_1_1,l1,level,did not exactly understand this experiment seems to be just depending on luck
767,1_10_2_1,l1,level,just luck dont know
768,1_10_4_1,l1,level,"I feel blue :,("
769,1_10_1_2,l1,level,maybe now the other way around dont know
770,1_10_4_2,l1,level,I feel red now :<

772,1_10_2_2,l1,level,I feel red. Just a feeling
773,1_11_2_1,l1,level,Let's vote red. One person has blue and may pick blue. Red is safe. I like turtles
774,1_11_4_2,l1,level,red for turtles
775,1_11_3_1,l1,level,Let's go with red. As all teams should do at anytime. I like turtles
776,1_11_3_2,l1,level,pleeeassee pleeeasseee pick red.  we have to! Some guy just picked blue before and it was all bollocks. Also I like turtles
777,1_11_1_1,l1,level,I guess this is more about luck because there is no way to know it for sure. I would say blue just because of the higher probability. Also I like turtles Also it is likely that one other teram will pick blue and then it is that color anyways
778,1_11_2_2,l1,level,Same logic. I like turtles!
779,1_11_4_1,l1,level,red for turtles
780,1_11_1_2,l1,level,"i'd choose red because theres a higher chance. I tink at least one other team will vote for blue like all the time :D So if blue is correct, theres achance to get 200 anyway"
781,1_12_1_1,l1,level,the probobility is higher that its a red urb
782,1_12_1_2,l1,level,It is just a guess
783,1_12_2_2,l1,level,it is more likely that it is a red urn
784,1_2_4_1,l1,level,Turtles like red.
785,1_2_4_2,l1,level,Even turtles choose red.
786,1_2_1_1,l1,level,2/3 chance of blue. GO blue!
787,1_2_2_1,l1,level,"we have a chance of 2/3 to be right, but if one vote blue, all is blue, that's why i vot red"
788,1_2_2_2,l1,level,"Choosing blue isn't as helpful as choosing red, because: only one blue ball can overturn our whole decision but only a unanimous decision for red can help us the same way"
789,1_2_1_2,l1,level,GO Blue again! 2/3 chance of blue urn
790,1_3_1_1,l1,level,I would choose red. Maybe there are 2 blue balls in the red urn and we have one of it and the other member votes blue.
791,1_3_3_2,l1,level,this time we could try a blue urn
792,1_3_2_2,l1,level,maybe this time its red :)
793,1_3_1_2,l1,level,I would choose blue. Blue urn is more likely.
794,1_3_4_1,l1,level,"just because of the game system .. its luck, isnt it?"
795,1_3_2_1,l1,level,Sinc the first part im not really sure about my decision
796,1_3_4_2,l1,level,just because of the game system
797,1_4_3_2,l1,level,"I would go with red If the color of the urn is blue, there is probably another team that took blue"
798,1_4_3_1,l1,level,"I would still go with red. Although there is no way to know for sure, our chances are still higher if we take red Someone else may vote blue regardless."
799,1_4_1_1,l1,level,I think we have one of the 2 blue balls. But the urn is nevertheless red.
800,1_4_4_1,l1,level,"no clue, red is safe"
801,1_4_2_1,l1,level,We only need one vote in the comitee in order for our whole vote to be blue. I would stick with red and if someone elese has blue they will most likely vote blue.
802,1_4_1_2,l1,level,There is no point for us to take blue I think the chances for us to get the right color are higher if we stick with red
803,1_4_4_2,l1,level,red is safe
804,1_4_2_2,l1,level,Same argument
805,1_5_3_2,l1,level,"red, because if any other is taking blue, it'll be blue"
806,1_5_3_1,l1,level,"Once again I'd take red, because if any other is taking blue, it'll be blue anyways"
807,1_5_1_1,l1,level,let's vote red. One person has blue and may pick blue. Red is safe.
808,1_5_1_2,l1,level,"At least on team may always vote blue, if two teams has blue even more likely. We will be safe if we vote red. Red is less likely to have an effect. our vote would not change anything in this case so we should stay with red"

812,1_5_2_2,l1,level,"I'd take red, because someone else can always pick blue as they draw blue for sure"
813,1_6_3_2,l1,level,Chances are higher that we got a red ball out of a red urn (66%). Therefore I'd go for RED
814,1_6_1_1,l1,level,"well, chances that the urn is red and we get a red ball are 66%. chances to get a red ball out of a blue urn are only 33%. I'd say RED."
815,1_6_1_2,l1,level,Chances that we get a blue ball out of a blue urn are 66%. Chances for getting a blue ball out of a red urn are only 33%. I'd say BLUE. It is just more likely that the urn is blue. Last round this strategy went well!
816,1_6_2_1,l1,level,50 50 chance to get red at least 50 50 could also be 100 percent
817,1_6_4_1,l1,level,It is much more likely to get a red ball out of a red urn (66%). Therefore I'd definitely go for red.
818,1_6_3_1,l1,level,It is more likely that we got a blue ball out of a blue urn (66%). Chances that the urn was red and we got a blue ball are 33%. Therefore I'd say blue.
819,1_6_4_2,l1,level,We gotta pick red. Chances are higher that the urn is red and OMG I hope that crazy person who picked blue will NOT do so this time So please let's go for red. Chances are 66%.
820,1_6_2_2,l1,level,50 50 chance to get red at least 50 50 could also be 100 percent
821,1_7_1_1,l1,level,The probability of a blue urn is higher.
822,1_7_1_2,l1,level,Again higher proability of blue urn.
823,1_7_4_2,l1,level,same no clue

826,1_7_2_2,l1,level,random guess
827,1_7_2_1,l1,level,too complicated best to play random
828,1_8_1_1,l1,level,"I suggest red because we don't hurt anyone with this decision If one of the others go for blue because they have a blue ball, the committee decision would be blue anyway"
829,1_8_1_2,l1,level,"I suggest red because we don't hurt anyone with this decision If the others go for blue because they have a blue ball, the committee's decision will be blue regardless of our decision"

831,1_8_3_1,l1,level,"It is more likely than not that we have a correct ball Nevertheless, we could be the deciding vote for blue if the other two choose red"

833,1_8_2_1,l1,level,I suggest we choose red because we don't hurt anyone with this decision
834,1_8_2_2,l1,level,"I suggest we choose red because that does not hurt anyone If the others (with blue balls) go for blue, the decision will be blue anyway"
835,1_8_4_2,l1,level,"I believe we have the correct color There is no specific reason behind it If you think that the danger to decide the whole vote for blue is to high, I will go with red"
836,1_9_1_1,l1,level,The probability of getting a red ball from a _red_ urn is 0.5 *two thirds. So it is just one third. red ball from blue urn - one sixth. that we got a correct ball - also two thirds.
837,1_9_3_2,l1,level,"probability of pecking a blue ball from a blue a urn is two times higher, that doing the same thing but with a red urn."
838,1_9_1_2,l1,level,pr(correct blue ball from a blue urn)= 0.5*0.66*0.66 pr(blue ball from red urn)= 0.5*0.33*0.33

841,1_9_2_1,l1,level,"There should be used basian probability formula for counting a correct probability, but i don#t remember it exactly. Just out of the common sense: a probability to get a right ball is two times higher."

843,1_9_2_2,l1,level,"If we think, that a correct ball is chosen, it makes sence to vote for a red urn. because of the higher probabilities."
844,2_1_2_2,l1,level,"Red ball, red urn ok"
845,2_1_3_2,l1,level,chances are higher that it is red
846,2_1_4_2,l1,level,red my guess was ALWAYS correct
847,2_1_2_1,l1,level,blue ball so my guess is blue urn
848,2_1_4_1,l1,level,"my guess was never incorrect, so I will stick to red ball red urn"
849,2_10_4_1,l1,level,the likelyhood is higher if everyone stays with his colour
850,2_10_1_1,l1,level,its more possible that the urn is blue too like our ball because there are two balls of the correct colour and only one of the other
851,2_10_2_2,l1,level,the likelyhood to win is higher if we vote our color
852,2_10_2_1,l1,level,the likelyhood to win is higher if we vote blue
853,2_10_1_2,l1,level,the likelyhood is bigger that the urn has the same colour like the ball
854,2_10_4_2,l1,level,likelyhood is higher if eyeryone stays with his colour
855,2_11_3_1,l1,level,"Even if we're observing the wrong color, it would still make sense to pick a color which has the highest chance. therefore I would pick red"
856,2_11_2_1,l1,level,I guess red has a higher chance to be correct
857,2_11_1_2,l1,level,I would chose red
858,2_11_3_2,l1,level,I guess blue has a higher chance
859,2_11_4_1,l1,level,red has a higher chance
860,2_11_2_2,l1,level,At least that's my guess.
861,2_12_4_1,l1,level,pure randomness
862,2_12_3_2,l1,level,"two times the correct answer was red, now it should be blue maybe? but im not sure"
863,2_12_4_2,l1,level,now it should be blue i think
864,2_2_1_1,l1,level,The probability of our urn being the coulour of the ball is 2/3 while the probability of the other colour is 1/3
865,2_2_4_1,l1,level,There's a higher probability of the whole urn being red. Also we just need one vote for blue in order to turn the complete urn blue. So I would stick with red.
866,2_2_3_1,l1,level,Higher probability.
867,2_2_4_2,l1,level,There's a higher probability of the whole urn being blue.
868,2_2_2_1,l1,level,Probability is higher.
869,2_2_1_2,l1,level,Probability that red is the right colour is higher.
870,2_3_1_1,l1,level,the chance that we recieve the wrong ball is smaller than the chance that we receive the correct ball However I think every team will think in the same way and there is no chance that the committe gets it right...
871,2_3_4_1,l1,level,Statistically the chance that we receive the correct ball is higher
872,2_3_3_1,l1,level,Statistically there is a higher chance that we receive the correct color
873,2_3_2_1,l1,level,The chance that we observe one of the 4 correct balls is higher
874,2_3_2_2,l1,level,Staistically there is a higher chance that we see the correct ball
875,2_3_3_2,l1,level,The chance that we see the correct color is higher...
876,2_3_4_2,l1,level,the chance that we receive the correct color is higher
877,2_3_1_2,l1,level,Hm... the chance of it being the correct color is higher than it being the wrong one
878,2_4_4_2,l1,level,Bigger likelyhood of observing right color and bigger likelyhood of ball having same color as urn
879,2_4_3_1,l1,level,"more likely that we are a team observing the right urn, and bigger chance of same colored ball being drawn from urn"
880,2_4_4_1,l1,level,Bigger likelyhood that we observe the right color and bigger likelyhood of ball having same color as the urn
881,2_4_3_2,l1,level,same likelyhoods as in first round
882,2_4_1_1,l1,level,Blue colored urn is more likely right now because it is more likely for a blue ball to be drawn from the blue urn
883,2_4_2_1,l1,level,it is more likely that we are a team oberserving a right urn and then it is more likely for the balls colored like the urn to be drawn
884,2_4_1_2,l1,level,It is a red urn just because I think it is we are the team observing the wrong urn because the other two were right when voting for red
885,2_6_1_1,l1,level,No clue so far. Ask me again next time.
886,2_6_2_1,l1,level,more likely 4:2
887,2_6_3_1,l1,level,more likely: 66%
888,2_7_1_1,l1,level,"red blue 50 50, I go blue"
889,2_7_3_2,l1,level,Red?
890,2_7_4_1,l1,level,Chances for blue are higher I guess
891,2_7_4_2,l1,level,higher chances for blue
892,2_7_2_1,l1,level,I don't have a clue. Sorry
893,2_7_1_2,l1,level,red blue 50 50 my gues is blue
894,2_7_2_2,l1,level,I think it's time that red has to be correct for the first time :D
895,2_7_3_1,l1,level,Maybe blue. I don't know. It's all about luck
896,2_8_1_2,l1,level,possibilty for red ones is higher than for blue ones
897,2_8_3_2,l1,level,assumiing again that is more possible that we have picked the right color
898,2_8_3_1,l1,level,assuming that we have picked the right one
899,2_8_2_2,l1,level,"dont know what to pick, maybe blue again?"
900,2_8_1_1,l1,level,trying to stay with our color
901,2_8_2_1,l1,level,it is more likely as there are two blue balls and one red ball in the urn
902,2_9_1_2,l1,level,"If other teams picked a blue ball, they will vote for it. But if the urne is red, we can only win, if we chose red"
903,2_9_4_2,l1,level,"If red is right, we have to vote for it in order to win. If blue is right, at least one of the teams will for it, so we win as well vote*"
904,2_9_1_1,l1,level,"Lets vote for red, because if other teams picked a blue ball, they will vote for blue and blue will be chosen as right decision anyway. But in case, the right color of the urn is red, then the only way to pick it up is to vote for red"
905,2_9_3_2,l1,level,"If the right color is red, we have to vote for it to pick it up. If it is blue, then the second team will vote for it"
906,2_9_2_1,l1,level,"Lets pick up the red urne to make sure it will be chosen if it is the right one. If not, at least one of the 4 teams will vote for blue"
907,3_1_1_1,l1,level,"Even if we have a blue urne the possibility of another team voting for blue is high, so blue is more likely to be picked. If we do have a red urne however and are the only team that had the blue ball, we'll mess up our chances to earn more simply by voting for blue. Please vote red."
908,3_1_3_1,l1,level,"Red is just as likely as blue By voting blue we could risk the situation of hyving a red urne and two votes pro red - and ours blue So that we'd be stuck with blue If this is blue, chances are, the other team observing blue will vote blue So, strategically speaking, voting red here is the smarter decision"
909,3_1_2_1,l1,level,"Making a decision for blue is way riskier than choosing red because of how the votes are counted If it really is blue, three other teams will have a blue ball and the chance that one of those teams votes blue is really high - blue would be chosen as our commitees pick If it is red however, us voting blue would make our commitees vote blue and therefore wrong"
910,3_1_4_1,l1,level,Higher chance to have the red urn. However I think every team will think in the same way and there is no chance that the committe gets it right... Red is less risky.
911,3_1_4_2,l1,level,"Red needs to voted by all If we witness a red ball, we should definitely vote red, as well It is safer to vote red and better for the other teams."
912,3_1_2_2,l1,level,Picking red when picking a red ball is the only logical thing to do Because voting blue will automatically turn the commitees choice to blue Red is safe to vote for the commite. Someone may vote blue.
913,3_1_1_2,l1,level,"Blue is \qdominant\q - if only one team chooses blue, it will make our commitees decision blue So choosing red when you see a red ball is the only logic consequence Choosing blue whilst seeing a red ball is simply a stupid strategy"
914,3_1_3_2,l1,level,"Because of the voting rules, red is much more unlikely to be made the choice but just as likely as blue to be picked Voting blue while picking a red ball makes no sense"
915,3_10_3_1,l1,level,without replacement has nothing changed with the fact that if you see red you should vote for red
916,3_10_4_2,l1,level,only rational decision is to go with red
917,3_10_4_1,l1,level,higher chances with red
918,3_10_2_2,l1,level,Red will give us the highest chance to win. Dont get influenced by part 1 the round
919,3_10_2_1,l1,level,"Based on our information, there is a higher chance that it is a red urne. Red is the only rational decision that gives us the highest chance"
920,3_10_1_2,l1,level,again based on our information there is a higher chance that it is a red urn
921,3_10_3_2,l1,level,There is a higher chance with blue! Don't get influenced by the first part of Round III.
922,3_10_1_1,l1,level,there is a 66% chance that it is a red urn
923,3_11_2_2,l1,level,The chance for a blue unre are 4/6 or 2/3. We should take blue
924,3_11_2_1,l1,level,The chance to get a red urne is 4/6 or 2/3. We should vote for red.
925,3_11_3_2,l1,level,Blue has a higher chance.
926,3_11_4_2,l1,level,who the heck voted for blue the last round.... Red is the only logical decision here too!
927,3_11_4_1,l1,level,"The chance for a red urne is higher. It isn't logical to base our decision on the choices of the other groups. Therefore, red."
928,3_11_3_1,l1,level,"Still, the chance is higher to get a red urne."
929,3_11_1_1,l1,level,"The chance in a blue in is higher to get a blue ball. Therefore, I would suggest to vote for the blue urn."
930,3_11_1_2,l1,level,"The chance of a red urne are 2/3. As we want to maximize our chance, we should vote for red."
931,3_12_4_1,l1,level,If we choose blue it is less risky
932,3_12_3_2,l1,level,"1/3 of all tems is observing wrong color, so lets stick with our ball color."
933,3_12_1_2,l1,level,2 out of 3 possibility that it is red
934,3_3_1_2,l1,level,"Again the chance of picking a red ball in a red urn is 2 to 3. Therefore, the urn is red."
935,3_3_2_2,l1,level,"Red has  2/3 chance. That is why I say that the urn's color is red, too."
936,3_3_1_1,l1,level,It is blue because we have a 2/3 chance of picking the right color. So I reason that the urn is blue.
937,3_3_3_1,l1,level,Blue has a 2/3 chance.
938,3_3_4_2,l1,level,Red still has a higher chance of winning. So I suggest the urn is red.
939,3_4_2_2,l1,level,Blue has a 2/3 chance
940,3_4_4_2,l1,level,"If 6 balls are drawn (1 for each team), it is likely, that one or more teams get a blue ball although the urn color is red (so that blue is less likely). As unanimity is required to decide for red, I would vote for red because in case most teams get a blue ball, one team will probably vote for blue, so that the decision is blue."
941,3_4_2_1,l1,level,Blue has a 2/3 chance.
942,3_4_1_1,l1,level,I think blue has a 2/3 chance
943,3_4_1_2,l1,level,Red has a 2/3 chance.
944,3_5_2_1,l1,level,"We have blue, more likely to get the bleu urn. Let's vote blue!"
945,3_7_2_1,l1,level,Take red. Higher chance.
946,3_7_2_2,l1,level,Red. The chance of oberserving the correct colour is bettet
947,3_8_2_2,l1,level,it is more likely to draw a red ball from the red urn. So the decision is red.
948,3_8_1_1,l1,level,"In the red urn there are 2 red balls and 1 blue ball whereas in the blue urn there are 2 blue balls and 1 red ball. Thus, it seems more likely that it is a red urn."
949,3_8_3_2,l1,level,"We should vote for red because for this colour unanimity is required. If the urn colour is red, 2 teams got a red ball and 1 team a blue ball. However, all 3 must decide for red to go trough. If the urn colour is blue, we are the only team with a red ball so that we can assume that at least one of the two teams with blue balls votes for blue. As for blue no  unanimity is requried,  the blue vote will go through."
950,3_8_4_2,l1,level,"We should vote for red as for this colour unanimity is required. If the urn colour is red, 4 teams will receive a red ball and 2 teams a blue ball. All teams must vote red to go thorugh. However, if the urn colour is blue, 4 teams got a blue ball and two teams got a red ball. However, one blue vote is enough for the decision to go through."
951,3_8_1_2,l1,level,"Even if we're observing the wrong color, it doesn't matter, because there's a chance of 2/3 that the other teams are observing the right one and will chose the right one"
952,3_8_2_1,l1,level,It is more likely to draw a blue ball from the blue urn. So the decision is blue.
953,3_8_4_1,l1,level,"We should vote for red because for this colour unanimity is required. If the colour of the urn is red, 4 teams got a red ball and 2 teams got a blue ball. For the decision to go through all teams must vote for red. If the colour of the urn is blue, 4 teams got a blue ball and 2 teams got a red ball. For blue to go through it is enough that one teams votes for blue. As 4 teams got a blue ball in this case it is very likely that at least one of them votes for blue and thus decides the vote"
954,3_8_3_1,l1,level,"We should vote for red because for this color unanimity is required. if the urn is red, the other teams both got a red ball and we got the blue ball, so that we need to vote for red If the color of the urn is blue, we and another team got a blue ball and one team got a red ball. As for blue no unanimity is required, we can expect the other blue ball team to choose blue, so that the overall decision will be blue."
955,3_9_4_2,l1,level,we need to stick with red no matter what actual color is. its only logical to choose red based on the voting rule
956,3_9_4_1,l1,level,we should stick with red no matter what color actually is right. if its blue at lease one other team will pick blue and we all win
957,3_9_1_1,l1,level,"there is a 2/3 chance that red ball is the correct one. if its actuall red, one other team should receive the red as well and they probably will choose red. even if its blue, i guess the team receive blue will choose blue and the final vote will be blue"
958,3_9_3_1,l1,level,"only by choosing red we all have a bigger chance to win. if the result is blue, at least one team might choose blue and we will win. but if it turned out to be red, we just have to hope that the one team who got the blue ball stick with choosing red. no matter what color we get, we all should choose red. its the only logical choice to make"
959,3_9_3_2,l1,level,"we should choose red no matter what color we got. its the only logical choice to make because if the result is red, we are the onlv team who got the wrong color and our decision is critical. if its blue, one other team should also got blue color and might stick with blue if they dont think in our way, and we will still win. stick with red have a bigger chance to win either way"
960,3_9_1_2,l1,level,"we should choose red. because if its actually red, the other 2 team will choose red and we all win. if its actually blue, the other team who got blue ball will probably choose blue. and based on the rule the final vote will be blue. we win again"
961,3_9_2_2,l1,level,"lets vote for red. if its blue, at least one other team will pick blue and we will win. if its red, we just have to pray that other teams all pick red..."
962,3_9_2_1,l1,level,"based on the rule we better pick red because if its actually red, we have a bigger chance win. even if its blue, 3 other teams who got blue balls might choose blue, and we just need one team to vote for blue to win."
963,4_1_1_1,l1,level,"I guess the blue urn makes more sense, as there are twice as many blue balls in it than in the red urn."
964,4_1_2_2,l1,level,Double chance to get a red ball if we choose the red urn
965,4_1_1_2,l1,level,"We have a red ball. So it would be reasonable to choose the red urn. However, the chance that all five groups chose red is pretty low, so I'm not sure"
966,4_1_3_1,l1,level,chances to get red are higher
967,4_1_2_1,l1,level,Double chance to get a blue ball if we choose the blue urn
968,4_10_3_2,l1,level,please lets pick red !!!! cause if its blue to other teams will pick blue
969,4_10_1_1,l1,level,our probability to have a blue urn is 66% so I would go for blue ....
970,4_10_3_1,l1,level,got the red ball therefore I would pick red cause if anyone picks blue it will be blue
971,4_11_1_1,l1,level,Let's try red although it's very likely that someone chooses blue.
972,4_11_3_1,l1,level,I'd say \qalways choose red\q but maybe we should choose blue since everbody thinks \qalways choose red\q and it's 2/3 that we win.
973,4_11_2_1,l1,level,Always red is the way to go.
974,4_11_2_2,l1,level,Always red.
975,4_11_4_2,l1,level,red for sure. It's likely one of the others get blue then they vote blue anyway
976,4_11_3_2,l1,level,Seems like we should choose blue since it's 2/3.
977,4_11_4_1,l1,level,In this case I'd choose red. It's very likely that at least some of the other three teams choose blue so we should keep the chance to win if it's red.
978,4_12_2_2,l1,level,Lets see...
979,4_12_3_1,l1,level,higher probability of blue
980,4_12_1_1,l1,level,Our team has a blue ball :D So when we have at least two blue balls the other picks blue ball so we double our chance with the red ball;)
981,4_12_3_2,l1,level,higher probability of red this time
982,4_12_2_1,l1,level,Good luck :D Red ;)
983,4_12_1_2,l1,level,Same argument but now we have double chance with the red ball ;)
984,4_12_4_1,l1,level,Lets stick to the 2 out of 3 chance that it is really red
985,4_2_4_2,l1,level,we should pick red ( the oposite) to reach a consensus becaus eeveryone will think his decision is right
986,4_2_2_2,l1,level,double chance for red but it is really difficult to earn the 2 euros... but we should pick red
987,4_2_1_2,l1,level,We should choose red because the possibilty to observe the right ball is 2/3. Nevertheless we should reach a consensus with the other member to gain 2 euros
988,4_2_4_1,l1,level,we should choose the opposite to get the chnace to reach a consensus and gain 2 euros everyone will think his chose is right so we should pick red
989,4_2_2_1,l1,level,the possibility is 2/3 so we should pick red.
990,4_2_3_1,l1,level,I think we should choose the opposite to reach a consensus. 1/3 chance that our ball is the wong observation so lets pick blue
991,4_2_1_1,l1,level,We picked a blue ball. As the possibility to observe the right color is 2/3 we should choose the color which was observed the most.
992,4_2_3_2,l1,level,we should choose the opposite to reach a consensus and to have the chance to gain 2 euros
993,4_3_1_2,l1,level,red maybe?
994,4_3_2_2,l1,level,absolutly red this time I can feel it
995,4_3_2_1,l1,level,I feel blue
996,4_3_1_1,l1,level,blue?
997,4_4_2_2,l1,level,"I would choose red, because if it really is red and every other team picks red we would be the ones to ruin it if it really is red, and if it really is blue there is a big chance that one of the other three teams that picked a blue ball will actually say blue"
998,4_4_2_1,l1,level,"I think it is obvious to choose red, because if the true color is blue, I m sure one of the teams will choose blue."
999,4_4_3_1,l1,level,"I would choose red, because there is a huge possibility that it really is red and if we choose blue it won't matter what the other teams decide"
1000,4_4_1_1,l1,level,"I think the obvious choice here is red, if the color of the urn is blue, probably someone in the other team will get blue and choose it and we will still have the correct answer"
1001,4_4_1_2,l1,level,I think this is an obvious choice. Same argument as before.
1002,4_5_2_1,l1,level,the probability is 2/3 so it would make more sense to say red.. and this worked the last round for me
1003,4_5_3_2,l1,level,it's more probably that it's red
1004,4_5_4_1,l1,level,the probability is 2/3 so i would guess blue
1005,4_5_1_1,l1,level,most probably blue
1006,4_5_1_2,l1,level,because the probability is 2/3 it's more probable to be blue
1007,4_5_2_2,l1,level,the probability is 2/3 so choosing red would make sense
1008,4_6_1_1,l1,level,"Blue because probably our urn is blue, even though this would ruin the vote if the urn is red"
1009,4_6_3_2,l1,level,"every ball has to be picked. If its a red urn, we can win, if its a blue urn, lets hope for the others to vote blue"
1010,4_6_4_2,l1,level,"The probability for the blue urn is higher (66,67 %)."
1011,4_6_1_2,l1,level,"Definitely red! if we got the wrong ball and the others choose blue, than we will still win."
1012,4_6_3_1,l1,level,"red, because even if its a blue urn someone has to pick the red ball.. what if its us?"
1013,4_6_2_2,l1,level,"Same logic --> if red, we are right, if blue, we can still win"
1014,4_6_2_1,l1,level,"Definitely red, if the majority of others pick a blue ball there will be at least one group that chooses blue  --> if red urn, we are right, if blue urn, we can still win"
1015,4_7_3_1,l1,level,twice more likely to win with our ball color
1016,4_7_4_1,l1,level,maybe we always vote red to be safe. others can always vote blue.
1017,4_7_4_2,l1,level,"if you see red, say red. if you see blue think about to lie"
1018,4_7_3_2,l1,level,voting our ball color is the best move to get the 2/3 chance to win
1019,4_8_2_2,l1,level,If its a red urn only one or two others will have blue aswell. So the probability is high that nobody does a wrong choice. if it s blue four others will have blue aswell and i do not believe that everybody has thoughts about how to prevent this. so lets vote red. if blue people will see
1020,4_8_2_1,l1,level,"So I see a high probability, that by 6 choices at least one or maybe two teams will have the wrong colour. Maybe its us. In what I do not believe is that all gonna have a thought about how to prevent this. Therefore I d choose red, no matter what. If there are 1 or 2 more who have blue balls its about them. If there are 3 or 4 more with blue its prabably a blue urn and not everyone will take red. So red!"
1021,4_8_1_2,l1,level,Definetly let vote red! If its not a red urn it s enough to have one other vote of an other team. So that we all have red is not that ...
1022,4_9_1_1,l1,level,more likely to be blue
1023,4_9_3_1,l1,level,always opposite of what was picked
1024,5_10_2_2,l1,level,"Although the likely hood is less, there is still a chance the urn is blue"
1025,5_10_3_2,l1,level,it actuallzy makes no difference so lets just go with red for lulz
1026,5_10_2_1,l1,level,the likely hood of the urn being red is 2/3
1027,5_10_3_1,l1,level,lets just choose red for the lolz
1028,5_10_4_2,l1,level,lol
1029,5_11_4_1,l1,level,"in general there 50:50 percent that the ball is trully red or blue. At least Two teams alwayes receives blue balls, and only one vote for a blue ball is enough. I suggest to vote for red"
1030,5_11_1_1,l1,level,"We received a red ball, so its twice more likely that the urn is red than it is blue. We are interested in the correct guess to earn more money)"
1031,5_13_2_1,l1,level,higher chance
1032,5_13_1_2,l1,level,it is more likely that we are in blue
1033,5_13_4_1,l1,level,"I suggest we vote red. There is a 50/50 chance that the urn is red, but we don't lose anything by choosing red. If the urn is red, and all other teams choose red, we win if even one person chooses blue - the committee's decision is blue, so our decision won't make a difference."
1034,5_13_4_2,l1,level,"we have a blue ball, but even if the urn is blue, the committee doesen't loose anything from our decision to vote red as I wrote before."
1035,5_13_2_2,l1,level,"i'd choose blue because theres a higher chance. I tink at least one other team will vote for blue like all the time :D So if blue is correct, theres achance to get 200 anyway"
1036,5_13_3_1,l1,level,"i think the  other teams will pick the blue urn because threres a higher chance , thats why I'd choose red"
1037,5_13_1_1,l1,level,"there are two times more red balls, higher chance that this is the right urn"
1038,5_14_4_2,l1,level,"Red is the dominant strategy once again. If the solution really is blue, at least one of the other (six!) teams will choose blue and that is already sufficient as the comitees decision (see rules) If the urn really is blue, 4 teams have received a blue signal and at least one of those teams wont know that red is the dominant strategy"
1039,5_14_4_1,l1,level,"Red is the dominant strategy once again. If the solution really is blue, at least one of the other six(!) teams will choose blue and that is already sufficient as the comitees decision (see rules) Copy this explanitaion for the next round to your next partner"
1040,5_14_1_1,l1,level,Singnal is more likly red
1041,5_15_4_2,l1,level,"i think we sould take red, because if one of the other teams take blue our desicion is not relevant"
1042,5_15_4_1,l1,level,"i think we should take red, because our chance is 2/3 that it is right"
1043,5_15_2_2,l1,level,"2/3 change to be blue, i think we should take blue"
1044,5_15_3_2,l1,level,"i think we take red because if the ball was in a red urn, the chance was 2/3 to take it"
1045,5_15_1_1,l1,level,"i'm not sure... if we take red and one of the others not, blue is taken, so i think we should take red. If one of the others is sure and take blue, it will be blue fianlly finally"
1046,5_15_3_1,l1,level,"Let's take the opposite colour of our ball, because if the urn is red, there is still one red ball and one blue ball in it and our chance is 50:50 if the urn is blue there is no red ball in it now and blue is 1005 right"
1047,5_15_1_2,l1,level,"i'm not sure... i guess it's red, because if the urn is red, it's more likely that the ball is red..."
1048,5_15_2_1,l1,level,"i'm not sure. But 4 balls have the same colour, so if blue is one of the 4 balls, i think we should take blue"
1049,5_17_4_1,l1,level,"we don't know the drawing order so we could be first,  last or somwhere in between so i'd say just stick with the color we are given"
1050,5_17_1_1,l1,level,chances are it's a red urn not much more we can do about it
1051,5_17_4_2,l1,level,somebody will pick blue anyways so i suggest just stick with red if it's a red urn and nobody picked blue we win and if it's a blue urn somebody will probably have picked blue already
1052,5_17_3_1,l1,level,i don't think that anything changed significantly regarding our odds to be right here bc we don't know when drawing we had in the order so i'd say just stick with the given color
1053,5_17_1_2,l1,level,gotta stick with the odds and the odds are telling us that it's a blue urn
1054,5_18_3_1,l1,level,I would choose red. Maybe there are 2 blue balls in the red urn and we have one of it. If so other team may vote blue. No need to vote blue.
1055,5_18_2_2,l1,level,blue is more likely because of the game system ...
1056,5_18_3_2,l1,level,I would choose red. The others have blue and pick blue.
1057,5_18_1_2,l1,level,"We got a blue ball, so in a blue urn there will be two times more blue balls"
1058,5_18_2_1,l1,level,red ball -> red urn
1059,5_19_3_1,l1,level,blue is 2/3 chance
1060,5_19_3_2,l1,level,I have no luck
1061,5_19_2_2,l1,level,stick with the blue one?
1062,5_19_1_1,l1,level,higher odds of red
1063,5_19_1_2,l1,level,higher odds of red
1064,5_19_2_1,l1,level,best option should be stick with red
1065,5_2_1_1,l1,level,The only rational thing we can do is to choose the color which our ball has. Then we have the highest probability to win.
1066,5_2_4_1,l1,level,Same thing as before. If we choose the opposite color we can be 100% sure to win because of the non replacement of the balls.
1067,5_2_2_2,l1,level,Always choose the opposite color! If the urn is blue 4 teams will see a blue ball and 2 teams will see a red one. If every team chooses the opposite color then blue will be the committees guess
1068,5_2_4_2,l1,level,"I am tired of explaining it, but please choose the opposite color. If every team does that we will win 100%."
1069,5_2_1_2,l1,level,This experiment is just fucked up. There is actually no rational strategy.
1070,5_2_3_1,l1,level,"Always the opposite color! In case we have a red urn 2 teams will see a red ball and one team will see a blue one. If every team chooses the opposite color, we will have two votes for blue and one for red . Ergo we can be sure to win!"
1071,5_2_3_2,l1,level,"Choose red. By choosing the opposite color we can be sure to win. urn is red -> 2 teams will se red, one team blue -> everyone chooses the opposite and red will be the guess"
1072,5_20_3_1,l1,level,red is more likely and no risk
1073,5_21_4_1,l1,level,Maybe we are one of the 4 groups observing the correct colour.
1074,5_21_1_2,l1,level,"We have blue, but i think we should vote red. Maybe the others, if they have blue will decide blue and if not, it will be red ;)"
1075,5_21_4_2,l1,level,More likely to have red. Lets hope were lucky.
1076,5_21_3_2,l1,level,"I think we got the wrong colour. So lets try red.. if there is an other team with blue, maybe they will vote blue and it will be blue."
1077,5_21_3_1,l1,level,Lets try red :) the other may have blue and then vote blue and it will be blue anyway
1078,5_21_2_2,l1,level,same as before by red :D
1079,5_21_2_1,l1,level,things got complicated :( .. I go with my gut feelin and vote blue. Just a feeling
1080,5_22_4_1,l1,level,No idea. Convince me please Red?
1081,5_22_2_2,l1,level,Red is my lucky colour :-) I'm in for red!
1082,5_22_3_1,l1,level,"So far, I've not read a message here from my team partner...People in this Messenger are as active as in ICQ Red, because someone will take blue so I'm indifferent"
1083,5_22_1_2,l1,level,"Red, because why not and someone is going to vote for blue anyway Odds for red are higher though, so let's play safe"
1084,5_22_3_2,l1,level,"So one red ball is gone, right? That makes the odds for blue higher, isn't it? I'm taking blue unless you take red"
1085,5_22_2_1,l1,level,blue will bring us luck and fortune
1086,5_22_4_2,l1,level,Here is my lucky guess we should vote for RED...
1087,5_23_3_1,l1,level,There are 2 possibilities: 1) We have the only blue ball a) we choose blue --> committee chooses blue --> wrong b) we choose red -- committee chooses red --> right 2) we are one of two teams that has blue a) we choose blue --> c blue --> right b) we choose red --> other team might --> don't know so we should choose red
1088,5_23_3_2,l1,level,"Red is the dominant strategy! We won with red last round, even though our ball was blue."
1089,5_23_1_2,l1,level,67% chance of being right
1090,5_23_4_2,l1,level,higher odds
1091,5_23_1_1,l1,level,"if we select the color we picked, we have a 67% chance of being right. That's why I would pick blue."
1092,5_23_4_1,l1,level,gotta trust the odds
1093,5_24_2_2,l1,level,I think we should go with red again.. Its sort of of a higher chance to win if everyone picks red
1094,5_24_3_2,l1,level,Again I think we should go with red.
1095,5_24_4_2,l1,level,Should we go with read again? Worked out very well last round.. :D sort of
1096,5_24_3_1,l1,level,I think we should stick to read. The chances that everyone picks the red ball are really small so we are save with read I hope
1097,5_24_1_2,l1,level,"Let's choose red. If the urn is blue, it's very likely that someone of the other teams with blue balls will choose blue. But if it's red, we have still the chance to win."
1098,5_24_2_1,l1,level,"I think we should go with the red one, because of the 'unanimity voting rule'.. Hope its the right idea :)"
1099,5_24_4_1,l1,level,"To be honest, I have no idea anymore. I even have no idea if  I understood the instructions because my last teampartner said, I was wrong.. but I was absolutely shure (after teh first part) that I was right so, yeah. I go with whatever is your suggestion"
1100,5_4_4_1,l1,level,on should always vote red as someone may always vote blue
1101,5_4_2_2,l1,level,I believe it does not really matter what u pick. We will be correct as a committee in about 50% of all cases
1102,5_4_1_2,l1,level,It makes sense to always vote for blue. The chance of all 3 groups having the ball of the same color as the urn it was drawn from are below 30 percent. The voting mechanism makes red as an answer way more likely than it should be.
1103,5_4_1_1,l1,level,Our best choice is to pick red. We observed a red bal being drawn. Nonetheless even if its a blue urn that happens in 1/3 of all draws. The probability that all three groups observe a ball being drawn that has the same color as the urn its drawn from is just below 30 percent.
1104,5_4_3_1,l1,level,50% of the cases we will be correct. Doesn't matter what you pick.
1105,5_4_4_2,l1,level,Decision making should be the same as in the previous round. The consenus seems to have been to always pick red.
1106,5_4_2_1,l1,level,I do not think it matters what you pick
1107,5_5_2_1,l1,level,2/3 chance to be right
1108,5_5_4_1,l1,level,"it's without replacement, so its ok to say blue"
1109,5_5_2_2,l1,level,2/3 chanece to be right
1110,5_5_1_2,l1,level,"I'd say we take red If we take blue, and the other teams take red, which then turns out as the right color, we lose"
1111,5_5_3_1,l1,level,because there is a 2/3 chance to be right and no risc because its red
1112,5_6_3_1,l1,level,no matter what we choose theres equal chances of the color we pick being either right or wrong so im going for red
1113,5_6_2_1,l1,level,if the urn is blue that means there are 4 blue balls in there and therefore more chances of picking a blue ball
1114,5_6_4_1,l1,level,"the prbability of picking a red ball from a red urn is higher than the probabilityy of picking one from a blue urn, therefore im going for red"
1115,5_6_2_2,l1,level,"The chances of picking a red ball from a red urn are higher, plus probably someone is gonna pick blue anyways so lets place safe and pick red"
1116,5_6_1_1,l1,level,"Maybe it is better to give the consensus-thing a chance, rather thank just picking blue"
1117,5_7_4_1,l1,level,"fuck it, pick whatever you like ;) although I think, blue is the best choice because we picked blue but maybe, i'm not getting it"
1118,5_7_4_2,l1,level,wtf
1119,5_7_2_2,l1,level,The chance for a blue urn are bigger as we picked a blue ball
1120,5_7_3_2,l1,level,red is more likely because of the game system and we picked red
1121,5_7_1_2,l1,level,Red is the best possible choice
1122,5_7_1_1,l1,level,Red is the best possible choice
1123,5_8_2_2,l1,level,unicorns are real
1124,5_8_4_1,l1,level,"little johnny, can you tell me the name of 3 great kings who have brought happines into people lives drinKing, smoKIng, fucKing"
1125,5_8_4_2,l1,level,i am feeling it
1126,5_8_1_2,l1,level,same logic pick the color
1127,5_8_3_2,l1,level,last time you were wrong. i dont believe you anymore
1128,5_8_2_1,l1,level,just saw a red unicorn
1129,5_8_1_1,l1,level,first one is red. so the chances is 66/33
1130,5_9_3_1,l1,level,i would vote for red bc if we chose blue the commitees decision wold be determined by our vote
1131,5_9_1_2,l1,level,let s now pick the shown colour bc the others now will probably enter their opposite colour and be scared to vote blue when the ball is red
1132,5_9_4_2,l1,level,"i would pick red but if your suggestion is blue, ill go with blue too. if yours is red, we take red"
1133,5_9_4_1,l1,level,"blue urn is more likely, but I can pick red if you think it is red."
1134,6_1_1_1,l1,level,blue because why not i have no idea i think blue being the color of the urn is more likely
1135,6_1_2_1,l1,level,if it was taken from the urn it is more likely that it has the same color as the urn because there are more balls in that color so im going with blue
1136,6_10_1_2,l1,level,If we have the red ball weh should vote for red as the probability is higher that the urn is red and we don't know the colours of the other teams.
1137,6_10_4_1,l1,level,We will not lose anything by voting for red as the blue teams may decide to vote for blue and our vote would not change anything in this case so we should stay with red
1138,6_10_3_2,l1,level,We have a 2/3 chance of seing the right colour and if only one team votes for blue the committee's vote is blue so I would reccommend to stay at blue as the other team getting blue may decide to change its opinion and vote red when they have blue
1139,6_10_3_1,l1,level,The probability that the urn is red is 2/3 we will not lose anything with voting for red If just one team votes for blue the decision is blue so we would not change the decision by voting for red
1140,6_10_2_1,l1,level,"As we can assume, that some of the members getting the blue ball will vote for blue we should stay at red"
1141,6_10_1_1,l1,level,The probability that we have the blue urn is higher right?
1142,6_10_2_2,l1,level,I think we should stay at blue because the probability of the urn to be blue is 50/50 so the others may decide to take red as they assume that one team will choose blue but if every team thinks in this way we would lose
1143,6_11_1_2,l1,level,"We need to chose Red. If we are the only ones who picked blue, then the urn is red and we guess correct If the urn is blue, then the other guys (hopefully not following this logic), will pick blue so there will be at least one blue vote and we win as well If the others guys (also blue) think the same way then we lose But this is too many ifs :)"
1144,6_11_3_2,l1,level,More likely to be red
1145,6_11_2_1,l1,level,Pure randomness now :) I just pick red you can pick blue
1146,6_12_1_2,l1,level,"The blue on would be the dominant decision, if ours is the only one. So I would rather pick red."
1147,6_13_4_1,l1,level,randomly choosen
1148,6_13_3_2,l1,level,Let's try red. I think we need to match in this experiment
1149,6_13_3_1,l1,level,ok - i will choose the color that you choose before!!! :-)
1150,6_13_2_2,l1,level,"Ok, i dont think that it is \qblue-blue-red-red\q so lets vote for blue. \qblue-blue-red-blue\q :'D dont know why..."
1151,6_13_1_2,l1,level,Red is safe. One else will always blue
1152,6_14_2_2,l1,level,"Again, we have a red ball, let's vote blue for the same reason."
1153,6_14_1_1,l1,level,Risky to vote blue but others may not vote blue even when draw blue. I say we vote blue.
1154,6_14_2_1,l1,level,"I suggest we vote red. There is a higher chance that the urn is red. if even one person chooses blue - the committee's decision is blue, so our decision won't make a difference."
1155,6_14_1_2,l1,level,Again we need to make sure to vote blue as others may not vote blue even draw is blue.
1156,6_14_3_2,l1,level,"Or decision determines the committee's final answer. Last round one of the teams had picked a blue ball and still voted red, so the comittee won. Or because replacement is allowed in this part all teams had a red ball. Our best bet in my opinion is to choose blue."
1157,6_15_3_2,l1,level,"It is with replacement now, so it is the same compared to the previous rounds, both urns have balls in it, going for the higher chances that ours is the correct one"
1158,6_15_2_2,l1,level,"Well it is without a replacement, so the blue urn must be empty and it must be red urn"
1159,6_15_2_1,l1,level,2/3 chances that it is a blue urn
1160,6_15_3_1,l1,level,I am going for the higher chances that our pick is the correct one
1161,6_15_4_1,l1,level,Going for the higher chances that we have picked the correct one
1162,6_15_1_1,l1,level,"The chances are higher that we are correct, so it must be the blue urn if true"
1163,6_15_1_2,l1,level,"Last time was blue, so there the blue balls are now less, I am going for red again the chances are 2/3"
1164,6_16_2_2,l1,level,"Since we have drawn a blue ball, let's just pick blue, even though this will determine the whole committees decision."
1165,6_16_3_1,l1,level,"We see red, let's pick red."
1166,6_16_4_1,l1,level,"I'd just pick the colour we see, even though chances are that we pick the wrong colour and determine the teams decision."
1167,6_16_2_1,l1,level,"Since we have drawn a red ball, we should just vote for red."
1168,6_16_1_1,l1,level,It's more likely that we got a red ball if it's a red urn. Someone else can always pick blue as they draw blue for sure.
1169,6_16_3_2,l1,level,"Let's just go for what we see, even though we will consequently determine the teams decision."
1170,6_16_1_2,l1,level,I'm not sure if we should pick blue even though we draw a blue ball. If we pick blue it would determine the whole team's decision. That's why I'm suggesting red.
1171,6_17_3_2,l1,level,"I don't believe that I'm communicating to a real team partner anymore (more an automated answer), but what else should I guess than red."
1172,6_17_3_1,l1,level,It doesn't matter whether you take a ball with or without replacement. There is a chance of 8/27 that at least one team get a blue ball from a red urn.
1173,6_17_2_2,l1,level,Perhaps we have luck.
1174,6_17_1_1,l1,level,I see a red ball - what else should I guess as the color of the urn given the rules.
1175,6_17_2_1,l1,level,Please tell me if you are a real player and no fake account.
1176,6_17_1_2,l1,level,"The problem is following: At least one of the three teams will get a blue ball. This team - normally - will take blue as the guess of the color of the urn. So the overall teams' guess is blue, even if just one blue ball appeared (and this would mean that the actual color of the urn is red). So we should take red. Trust me - if it is actually a blue urn, another blue ball must be seen by another of the three teams. And this team will choose blue as their guess. This is enough for taking blue as the overall team voting."
1177,6_18_1_1,l1,level,"the probability for each ball is 33,33%, since we picked a blue ball its likely that the urn ist blue. however since there are no replacements on of the 3 team will unavoidably get the other color and if even one team votes for the other color the wong color will be the comittees guess."
1178,6_18_2_2,l1,level,"i think its probably better if we dont pick the same colour, so if i pick blue you should pick red"
1179,6_18_4_1,l1,level,lets hope we got the 2/3 chance of getting the right coloured ball
1180,6_18_3_2,l1,level,lets hope that we got the 2/3 chance of picking the right colour
1181,6_18_3_1,l1,level,"now that we're playing with replacement, the probability that its a blue urn ist higher, so lets go with blue"
1182,6_18_1_2,l1,level,if everyone chose the color of the ball they picked the probability of getting 2 would be 0%
1183,6_19_1_1,l1,level,"if its blue someone else has blue too, so they might vote blue and the end decission is true but if they both have red we should vote for red so that its true in that case too"
1184,6_19_2_2,l1,level,if tehre are 4 blues someone will say blue if there are 4 reds we should go for red so red is the logical decission here
1185,6_19_3_1,l1,level,just the higher chance of getting the right color
1186,6_19_2_1,l1,level,if tehre are 4 blues then hopefully somebody will say blue if tehre are only two chances are higher if we say red
1187,6_19_4_1,l1,level,is it over yet?
1188,6_19_3_2,l1,level,just take the higher chance here and if both others get blue they will vote for it
1189,6_19_1_2,l1,level,worked last time so same argumentation
1190,6_2_2_1,l1,level,twice as much red balls as blue balls
1191,6_2_4_1,l1,level,bigger chance
1192,6_20_3_2,l1,level,again red if the other draw blue they may not vote blue
1193,6_20_4_1,l1,level,"Given the voting system, voting red is safe. If any other team votes blue it will be blue"
1194,6_20_1_2,l1,level,i would choose the expected more likely result
1195,6_20_1_1,l1,level,"on of tree is red  for a red urn, if it is red all must choose red so i suggest red"
1196,6_20_2_1,l1,level,"as a red one picked, i expectd a red urne "
1197,6_20_2_2,l1,level,"four red ones,two blue ones, i suggest a red urne"
1198,6_20_3_1,l1,level,based on probability and what others will do i would always choose red
1199,6_21_1_1,l1,level,our team picked a blue ball so more likely our urn is blue
1200,6_22_3_2,l1,level,I guess it's a blue urn- Let's believe in it
1201,6_22_4_1,l1,level,I think it's a red urn-because there are four balls of the same colour and we give the ball back in the urn I think it's a red urn- Let's believe in it!
1202,6_22_2_1,l1,level,I think it's a red urn because we picked a red ball The chance is higher that we picked a red ball then a blue one I'm very sure that it is a red ur n Because of the distribution of the balls
1203,6_22_1_2,l1,level,I think it is a red urn because we took a red ball In the urn are more red balls and then is the chance higher to take a red ball I think it is a red urn
1204,6_22_3_1,l1,level,I think it's either a red urn because we picked a red ball
1205,6_22_1_1,l1,level,"I thin it can be a blue ball because blue urn has more blue balls, but I'm not totally sure"
1206,6_22_2_2,l1,level,I think it's a blue urn because of the distribution of the balls The chance is higher to pick a blue ball because there are probably four of them in the urn and two red ones I would vote for the blue urn
1207,6_23_2_1,l1,level,Lets stick with it. Higher chances.
1208,6_23_4_1,l1,level,PURE LUCK!
1209,6_23_1_1,l1,level,Lets stick with the usally expected more likely  urn
1210,6_23_1_2,l1,level,More likely to be red. Lets stick with it
1211,6_23_3_1,l1,level,Lets believe in it;)
1212,6_23_2_2,l1,level,Lets stick with it. Higher chances.
1213,6_24_2_1,l1,level,Choosing red when you see a red ball is the only logic consequence. One blue vote makes the committee blue vote
1214,6_24_3_2,l1,level,With the new rule there is more chance of each individual to observe the wrong color. The choice of red is more hard. Only if all choose red  it should b red.
1215,6_24_3_1,l1,level,"I think as the new rule it would be more chance of each member to observe a wrong color. Since the comment of red should meet more critique, I suggest to choose red."
1216,6_24_1_1,l1,level,"In my opinion, if there is another person with blue they may be afraid of voting blue so we should vote blue to make sure."
1217,6_24_4_1,l1,level,After all of the round before I suggest us to choose red. The committe will choose red only when all of the teams choose red.
1218,6_24_2_2,l1,level,If the urn is blue there would be others who choose blue. Only when all choose red there will be red which means majority observes red.
1219,6_24_1_2,l1,level,We should vote blue again for the same reason
1220,6_3_1_1,l1,level,"the chance that it is blue is 2/3, so I go for blue otherwise one team will get red for sure, even if the urn is blue...so I don't know what is the best strategy"
1221,6_3_2_2,l1,level,There is a higher change blue is the color of the urn. But I am voting for the opposite as 2 teams get the wrong color for sure It is pure luck anyway :)
1222,6_3_3_1,l1,level,"Drawing WITH replacement, so the chance is always higher if we pick what we see therefore I am going for red"
1223,6_3_3_2,l1,level,"Lets stick with the color we have drawn, the chances are higher"
1224,6_3_2_1,l1,level,"I am voting for the opposite color as 2 teams have to do it in order to have a correct committee decision Of course there is a higher chance that blue is the color but we don't know, so it is pure luck after all"
1225,6_4_4_1,l1,level,last two rounds were blue so I dont know what color we shoul guess :D
1226,6_4_2_2,l1,level,"Red, always red! #teamred #gowildreds"
1227,6_4_2_1,l1,level,Take alsways read cause the chance of winning is higher and one other team will vote bleu! *red
1228,6_4_3_2,l1,level,I dont know the best way to win in this part. Thought always red would be as good as in the parts before but before we had a blue urn..
1229,6_4_1_2,l1,level,Let's take red cause if the urn is red and we got the opposite color aaaand we take blue the decision will be blue. Let's hope the other team isnt that intelligent (if they got blue as well) and will take the real color.
1230,6_4_1_1,l1,level,I think its a good idea if we take the ball color as our decision color. Others will probably take their real color and at least one other has blue.
1231,6_4_3_1,l1,level,Just take red please!! Its the only way to get 2!
1232,6_5_2_2,l1,level,"i think when thee red ball is picked you should vote red because if another team votes blue, the decision will be blue in the end anyways thus voting for blue is too risky just vote red to be safe"
1233,6_5_3_2,l1,level,"Same logic, vote red cheers"
1234,6_5_1_1,l1,level,"the probabiliity of picking the red ball from red urn was higher this means that the urn is more likely to be red now comes the important part!!! you should vote red because all members need to vote red in order to vote for red if ANYONE votes blue, we are screwed"
1235,6_5_4_1,l1,level,"Deutschland Deutschland uber alles, uber alles in der Welt Wenn es stets zu Schutz und Trutze Bruderlich zusammenhalt Von der Maas bis an die Memel Von der Etsch bis an den Belt"
1236,6_5_3_1,l1,level,i think when the ball is red it always makes more sense to vote for red because if you vote for blue you can fuck up the entire decision dont worry about blu as others may vote blue just go with red to be safe cheers
1237,6_5_2_1,l1,level,When its red ball you should vote red its too obvious and probably no explanation is needed even if the urn is blue somebody (4 teams ACTUALLY) will vote blue and therefore we will win anyways but if its red then EVERY team should vote red therefore going for red is a safe choice here
1238,6_5_1_2,l1,level,"if the urn is red, then everyone needs to vote RED, because if only 1 votes blue, our decision will be BLUE So please vote red :) cheers"
1239,6_6_3_2,l1,level,no clue
1240,6_6_1_2,l1,level,Blue urn with higher chance
1241,6_8_1_1,l1,level,"We see a red ball, so we should vote for it. If the other two teams see a blue ball, they will vote for it. But other decision will not have a negative influence. Therefore, we should take red to not diminish the option of a red urn."
1242,6_8_1_2,l1,level,"If the other two teams have each a blue ball, at least one will vote for it. But with that decision we will not eliminate the chance of an red urn."
1243,6_8_2_1,l1,level,"Hey! Let us stick with red. I cannot tell you why, but I have a good feeling about it. Cheers."
1244,6_8_3_2,l1,level,Hey! Let's try for red. There is now a higher probability that we see the wrong colour.
1245,6_8_2_2,l1,level,Hey!
1246,6_8_3_1,l1,level,Heeey! Higher probability for blue. So we should stick with the colour we have picked. Cheers. :)
1247,6_9_1_1,l1,level,"At least one other team has a blue ball. This team will very likely choose the blue urn. Thus, it has no consequence, which urn we choose, because the blue urn will be picked anyway. If both other teams have blue balls, the chances for this case is even greater. So I would pick red, to reach the consens, if one other team has a red ball and the urn is read."
1248,6_9_1_2,l1,level,"Wenn jedes Team seine Kugelfarbe whlt, hat man immer die blaue Urne. Und daher eine 50% Chance zu gewinnen. Wenn jedes Team immer rot whlt auch. Doch wenn wir immer rot whlen und die anderen Teams immer ihre Farbe, haben wir eine 66% Trefferquote. Daher immer rot whlen!!! Man erhht seine Chancen auf eine richtige Kugel nicht, wenn man blau whlt! *Richtige Urne"
1249,6_9_2_1,l1,level,"Menschen sind unberechenbar, wenn sie vor (Wahl-) Urnen stehen. Ich whle rot, um dem Konsens eine Chance zu geben."
1250,6_9_3_2,l1,level,"What you wrote is not correct, but it would take to long to explain why. The only thing that changed in a POSITIVE way is, that the chances are higher, that every team has the RIGHT ball. The conclusion is the same: Pick your own colour"

2953,1,l3,level,i think most people will go for 50? So the average will be about 35?
2954,2,l3,level,"If 50 were average, 2/3rds would be around 33. I would imagine the average to be above 50, and therefore guess around 39.Realisitically the answer will be between 33-66.So maybe higher than 39? Perhaps 43"
2955,3,l3,level,"Hey partner:) I am doing econs 2nd year, we've studied this experiment on our lectures let me just explain to you how it works: the average of all scores will ve centred arond 50, then if we multiply it by 2/3 it will give 33.3. HOWEVER, note that 33 is the number that most people will put, because they can calculate up to that point. YET whan majority fails to foresee is that if everyone puts 33, then the real target average is 22!and that's the number we should put in."
2956,4,l3,level,"60 seems close to the average between the number of 0 to 100, and i guess more people will choose the average no."
2957,5,l3,level,60
2958,6,l3,level,"I am not an economist, but I'm looking at at whole I think the avearge maybe around 60. Therefore, 40 would be the two thirds of this it also seems reasonable."
2959,7,l3,level,I would guess that the majority of people would pick a number in the lower stratum. Say 25 or 30 the two thirds average of this is around 15
2960,8,l3,level,"As the range of numbers is between 0 - 100, I think most of guys might be choosing a number close to 50, and since the two thirds of the average is choosen, the target number may be nearer to 40. it's just my thinking. Not sure really in this way this round works.. Waiting to see your suggested decision and then I will take a decision. Cheers."
2961,9,l3,level,guess
2962,10,l3,level,Considering it will calculate two thirds of the average.. wouldn't 60 be highly possible? It looks ideal for me. Any suggestions?
2963,11,l3,level,I guess a safe way would be to have one choose a low number lets say between 20 and 50 and the other between 50 and 80 .. your suggestions?
2964,12,l3,level,"I think it will be a rather low number, definitially below 50."
2965,13,l3,level,lets say everyone thinks the average will be 50 based on random probabilityand 2/3rds of that will be about 34hence they will mostly be choosing around 34 onlymaking the average 34and its 2/3rd to be around 21
2966,15,l3,level,say most of the people will say around 40 seomthing because they think that will be the 2/3 of the average. People thing the average will be around 50 or 60 so they get 2/3 of that that will be around 40 but if everyone does then the 2/3 of 40 will be less si i say it will be around 32 or so...
2967,17,l3,level,because it is relatively close to the middle?
2968,18,l3,level,"it's quite random, so just guess"
2969,19,l3,level,Well. i suppose mopst of the  eld will choose big numbers so that average will go up to 60-70. 2/3 of this number would be in range of 40-45
2970,20,l3,level,i just used 50 which is the average of 0 and 100.
2971,21,l3,level,"Theory says that we should play 0, as everyone will always try to beat everyone else by goingtwo thirdsless until everyone reaches 0. Whether everyone will follow this reasoning I don't know; it maybe better to bida bit higher since not everyone may choose 0."
2972,22,l3,level,"the target will be 50, so i chose 75, of whose (2/3) would be 50"
2973,24,l3,level,"Assuming that the overall total of the 6 teams is around 300, giving an average of about 50 iwould suggest 32 as a decision since some may tend above 50 while others below iti think the average will be around about 50 in which case we should submit an answer of about32 or 33"
2974,25,l3,level,"I'm no mathematician so I don't know what number to go for exactly which would give thegreatest chace*chanceso I'm just going with 50, unless you have a di erent tacticIf you're not sure either I will just go with 50 still"
2975,26,l3,level,I would give a small number as I think most people will go with number over 50+. I would gowith 22
2976,27,l3,level,"I thought i'd go for 26as we're aiming for 2/3rds of an average, which should be about 21if everyone aims for '50' or something around '50'The remianing 5 (21+5) would account for any deviations in the groupI think it's unlikely that anyone will choose numbers close to 0 or 100hence my decision"
2977,28,l3,level,"As our target is two-thirds of the average, we should call for the number which is lower than 66.I think 40 is a quite safe line, but possibly be reduced to 30s?"
2978,29,l3,level,"to be honest i have little directed thought about thisbut...say the average is 50, then two thirds of 50 is around mid-30si think?either way it's my lucky number!wow sorry thats not more helpful.i'll see what you've said though.. will probably make more sense!"
2979,30,l3,level,Between 35 and 40 because 2/3 of the average case number 50 would be 38.But it might be less if everyone is guessing lower
2980,31,l3,level,test. whats Yours?
2981,32,l3,level,"I suggest 66, because there are 6 teams each of them choosing a random number from 0 to 100then the average is found by adding those and dividing the sum by 6.Since we don't know the average in advnace let's assume 2/3 from 66 is 44"
2982,33,l3,level,normally people will choose the number 10-90 I think but I not surejust use your  rst reection to think about other people
2983,34,l3,level,"Hi there, I've just won last 2 test period's questions, what I did was i wrote a few reasons and give a number and this guess answer is bit further than the  nal answerfurther i mean and i chose the one in the middle well, not exactly in the middle, something like a little to the left and a little to the right however I won the last 2 rounds that i didn't get anything, I guess I am not going to win this, lolI am just being pestmistici think 50 is nash equilibrium, and i will choose one is between yours and mine it's best if you chose something in the middle as well as this is how I found for the last 2 rounds i mean won not found :P This is how i won the last 2 rounds hope this one will work... but this one is fully random I think people like big numbers, and a few will chose 50%because rationally this is where it is highly possible if they are rational but i like big numbers because wining 10 pounds makes me feel putting big numbers that's how I feel, and decision is totally up to you:) take care"
2984,35,l3,level,"i do not have a suggested decision as it is not based on any logic .. i cannot predict what theother teams will play and cannot  gure out how to work out what would be the best decision tomake.if you have any better ideas, i am willing to take your adviceif you dont have any better ideas, then i guess we will just be lucky..or not.."
2985,36,l3,level,"the problem is that we have to be BELOW the assumed average - which is tricky cos how shouldwe know? lets think about what's going on in ppl's minds: they're all facing the same question,so i reckon they'll go for ratherso lets try being below that as well and do something like 25 or maybe even 20 which would betwo thirds of their 30-40"
2986,38,l3,level,"I reckon most people will assume an average of 50 so go for 36 or 37 (2/3 of 50) so I suggestwe go for 2/3 of their guesses, say 25"
2987,39,l3,level,Random.
2988,40,l3,level,I think the result depends on others decision
2989,42,l3,level,i dont really get it. any suggestions
2990,43,l3,level,the average number goes toward the 50 if the participants are so many.even if the number of pariticipants is just 16but i suggest this number.
2991,44,l3,level,"Two thirds of 75 is 50, but I think other people will choose this, as this is an easy number.I do not think other people will think of 90 straight away."
2992,45,l3,level,"66 is two thirds, many may go for this number, for the connection."
2993,46,l3,level,I think that the average would be 50 and 2/3 of 50 is about 32
2994,47,l3,level,Hopefully the average should be about 50 because all the teams will choose a random numberand 35 is about 2/3 of 50
2995,48,l3,level,i would go for something high as it is unlikely that lots of people will go for something very lowand so that means we more likely to get closer to the averagebut im not sure really! that would be my suggestion
2996,49,l3,level,"I don't really know if there's a structure to this, so am picking a number that is close to twothirds of the half of 100."
2997,50,l3,level,88 is the year I was born and my lucky number. So this is my suggested decision
2998,51,l3,level,I don't understand! :-S
2999,52,l3,level,people may just go for half of one hundred because its like half way...numbers like 67 or 34 areless likely to be chosenmaybe?
3000,69,l3,level,57
3001,70,l3,level,what do you think?
3002,71,l3,level,"well i guess the average will be about 50-60, so this is roughly down to two thirds, what do yousay? :)"
3003,72,l3,level,"I think it is more possilbe around 30, and it should be less than 50 I think."
3004,73,l3,level,"I think there's got to be at least 8 or 9 teams, so I reckon thats got to come to at least 500 intotal, the average of which would be about 55-60, which gives 40 as two thirds of it.So I say we go for between 40 and 50"
3005,74,l3,level,it is better to take a high number in order to have a reduced choice for the  nal decision
3006,76,l3,level,"I think everyone will aim for a two-thirds number of less than 50, so the target number of whateveryone actually picks will be much lower! I think it'll be less than 30. As everyone will bepicking low numbers to allow for this. so i think 16"
3007,77,l3,level,"Average should be around 50 but I can't tell if it actually will be, 2/3s of 50 is about 34. So Ithink 34 is a good startI'm going with 34"
3008,78,l3,level,"If the answer is going to be two thirds of the average, it cannot be above 66 as this is two thirdsof 99I think most people will work that out and go for something around 50 ish, so I think 30-40 willget us in the right area"
3009,79,l3,level,"provided that a number of people will go for answer of 2/3s of a 100 (66) then we should go forananswer that is 2/3's of that (44), however, i suggest we scale the number down slightly if otherteams dothe same as ourselves, therefore I suggest 38. I am open to your theory"
3010,80,l3,level,i think a number around this number will possible give us the right ans as most people willchoose above 50
3011,81,l3,level,i guess if most people assume the teams average will be 50 then they will expect (2/3) to beaprox 33 and thiss will be their guesswhich would mean our guess should be 22however if other people assume the same then (2/3) average will be more like 7want to go with somewhere in the middle...# 12?
3012,82,l3,level,I worked on an average of 50 and then looked at two thirds and added on a bit for luck!
3013,83,l3,level,"most people willchoose a number under 50, but not too low, so I reckon it might be somewherein the region of 26:0 not entirely certain though!"
3014,84,l3,level,"The larger the number, the more likely we can predict the answer later."
3015,99,l3,level,"i think that the average number will be from 50 to 60, therefore 2/3 of this will be around 32 to40. so i chose 35"
3016,100,l3,level,"I'm assuming everyone will choose a large number.If we choose very large numbers, i.e 90 and above, it will severely increase the overall averagemaking it less likely that the overall average can be below 40, at least.Hopefully, this works in practice as well as in theory."
3017,101,l3,level,"i think most people will pick a number around 2/3rds of 100, but if this is so, 2/3rds of 60 willbe around 40.but then again, if everyone is thinkin glike this then the average will be rougly 30, so im notsure! but im going to go with 40."
3018,102,l3,level,"lets all pic 0!! if we pick 0 the averge is 0, our targer number is 0, and 2/3rds of 0 is 0!! wecannot lose!!!!!think about it keep it simeple. go 0!!!!"
3019,103,l3,level,"if people are varied from 0 to 100, the target number would be around 30,That answer would be the best way to be logical because we cannot guratee all the other's numberIf you have any prefency that they would prefer big number, that will be higher than 33, on else,will be below 30"
3020,104,l3,level,I reckon the average will be players saying 66/100 approx due to it being two thirds.I believe we should say two thirds of that number which would range between 40 and 50The lower range will probably be a wiser move as a few others will estimate lower.Personally i would be happy with anything between 38-42.
3021,105,l3,level,Every tries to guess the two-thirds of the average.If every one choose randomly from 0 {100 then the average would be 50then the two-thirds would be about 33so I would guess 33I am a Mathematican
3022,106,l3,level,Perhaps around 30 would be the safest bet?Because it's going to be 2/3 of the average... just an idea. i dont really have any mathimaticalcalculationsaround the suggestion.If you do.. I will follow your lead.
3023,107,l3,level,I think that most team players will say a number under 50 because every team contributes onenumber from the average of all teams 2/3 are taken. So everyone wil think that it is most likelyto be something under 50 and even less because whatever number it is 1/3 will fall away.I think it will be 18 because the average will be around 25 to 27 because everyone tries to saysomething already thinking that it will be subtracted by 1/3
3024,108,l3,level,"I assume that most teams will choose low initial numbers, as they will be aiming to undercutthe other teams, being closer to the 2/3 target pointBy choosing 20, i think that it will be high to be above the initial low numbers, whilst not beingso astronomically high as to rule us out entirely."
3025,109,l3,level,"I assume hat the average of all teams will be around 40, because most people tend to choosesmaller numbers(don't know why)So, I estimate that 23 is verly likely to be the closest to 2/3, but this is just a suugestion, ofcourse"
3026,110,l3,level,"I'm not entirely sure what sort of objective we are looking for, but as 66 is two thirds from 0 to100i suggest we choose this numberand again it's mere luck or probability which i'm not sure how to calculate."
3027,111,l3,level,"its the highest number, and i would expect its the most common one to pick."
3028,112,l3,level,"i just picked it because if about 50, the mid way point, is the average then 30 is about 2/3 ofthe average"
3029,113,l3,level,"Statistically, 50 would be the average and therefore two thirs of this would be roughly 33, how-ever i think, especially in the  rst round, people will be inlined to enter high numbers. So i thinkthat two thirs of the averageIf we both put in 100 and then estiamte somwehere near 60 i think we may have a better chance.Perhaps not as high as 60 but you get my reasoning."
3030,114,l3,level,"If we put in 100, we'll know that the average is going to be slightly higher than what it would beotherwise (as the average would probably settle at around 50) { I think a few people will havethis idea (as there's a lot2/3rds of the average will be around 50, and the actual average being 60something."
3031,1,l3,belief,i think most people will go for 50? So the average will be about 35?
3032,2,l3,belief,"If 50 were average, 2/3rds would be around 33. I would imagine the average to be above 50, and therefore guess around 39.Realisitically the answer will be between 33-66.So maybe higher than 39? Perhaps 43"
3033,3,l3,belief,"Hey partner:) I am doing econs 2nd year, we've studied this experiment on our lectures let me just explain to you how it works: the average of all scores will ve centred arond 50, then if we multiply it by 2/3 it will give 33.3. HOWEVER, note that 33 is the number that most people will put, because they can calculate up to that point. YET whan majority fails to foresee is that if everyone puts 33, then the real target average is 22!and that's the number we should put in."
3034,4,l3,belief,"60 seems close to the average between the number of 0 to 100, and i guess more people will choose the average no."
3035,5,l3,belief,60
3036,6,l3,belief,"I am not an economist, but I'm looking at at whole I think the avearge maybe around 60. Therefore, 40 would be the two thirds of this it also seems reasonable."
3037,7,l3,belief,I would guess that the majority of people would pick a number in the lower stratum. Say 25 or 30 the two thirds average of this is around 15
3038,8,l3,belief,"As the range of numbers is between 0 - 100, I think most of guys might be choosing a number close to 50, and since the two thirds of the average is choosen, the target number may be nearer to 40. it's just my thinking. Not sure really in this way this round works.. Waiting to see your suggested decision and then I will take a decision. Cheers."
3039,9,l3,belief,guess
3040,10,l3,belief,Considering it will calculate two thirds of the average.. wouldn't 60 be highly possible? It looks ideal for me. Any suggestions?
3041,11,l3,belief,I guess a safe way would be to have one choose a low number lets say between 20 and 50 and the other between 50 and 80 .. your suggestions?
3042,12,l3,belief,"I think it will be a rather low number, definitially below 50."
3043,13,l3,belief,lets say everyone thinks the average will be 50 based on random probabilityand 2/3rds of that will be about 34hence they will mostly be choosing around 34 onlymaking the average 34and its 2/3rd to be around 21
3044,15,l3,belief,say most of the people will say around 40 seomthing because they think that will be the 2/3 of the average. People thing the average will be around 50 or 60 so they get 2/3 of that that will be around 40 but if everyone does then the 2/3 of 40 will be less si i say it will be around 32 or so...
3045,17,l3,belief,because it is relatively close to the middle?
3046,18,l3,belief,"it's quite random, so just guess"
3047,19,l3,belief,Well. i suppose mopst of the  eld will choose big numbers so that average will go up to 60-70. 2/3 of this number would be in range of 40-45
3048,20,l3,belief,i just used 50 which is the average of 0 and 100.
3049,21,l3,belief,"Theory says that we should play 0, as everyone will always try to beat everyone else by goingtwo thirdsless until everyone reaches 0. Whether everyone will follow this reasoning I don't know; it maybe better to bida bit higher since not everyone may choose 0."
3050,22,l3,belief,"the target will be 50, so i chose 75, of whose (2/3) would be 50"
3051,24,l3,belief,"Assuming that the overall total of the 6 teams is around 300, giving an average of about 50 iwould suggest 32 as a decision since some may tend above 50 while others below iti think the average will be around about 50 in which case we should submit an answer of about32 or 33"
3052,25,l3,belief,"I'm no mathematician so I don't know what number to go for exactly which would give thegreatest chace*chanceso I'm just going with 50, unless you have a di erent tacticIf you're not sure either I will just go with 50 still"
3053,26,l3,belief,I would give a small number as I think most people will go with number over 50+. I would gowith 22
3054,27,l3,belief,"I thought i'd go for 26as we're aiming for 2/3rds of an average, which should be about 21if everyone aims for '50' or something around '50'The remianing 5 (21+5) would account for any deviations in the groupI think it's unlikely that anyone will choose numbers close to 0 or 100hence my decision"
3055,28,l3,belief,"As our target is two-thirds of the average, we should call for the number which is lower than 66.I think 40 is a quite safe line, but possibly be reduced to 30s?"
3056,29,l3,belief,"to be honest i have little directed thought about thisbut...say the average is 50, then two thirds of 50 is around mid-30si think?either way it's my lucky number!wow sorry thats not more helpful.i'll see what you've said though.. will probably make more sense!"
3057,30,l3,belief,Between 35 and 40 because 2/3 of the average case number 50 would be 38.But it might be less if everyone is guessing lower
3058,31,l3,belief,test. whats Yours?
3059,32,l3,belief,"I suggest 66, because there are 6 teams each of them choosing a random number from 0 to 100then the average is found by adding those and dividing the sum by 6.Since we don't know the average in advnace let's assume 2/3 from 66 is 44"
3060,33,l3,belief,normally people will choose the number 10-90 I think but I not surejust use your  rst reection to think about other people
3061,34,l3,belief,"Hi there, I've just won last 2 test period's questions, what I did was i wrote a few reasons and give a number and this guess answer is bit further than the  nal answerfurther i mean and i chose the one in the middle well, not exactly in the middle, something like a little to the left and a little to the right however I won the last 2 rounds that i didn't get anything, I guess I am not going to win this, lolI am just being pestmistici think 50 is nash equilibrium, and i will choose one is between yours and mine it's best if you chose something in the middle as well as this is how I found for the last 2 rounds i mean won not found :P This is how i won the last 2 rounds hope this one will work... but this one is fully random I think people like big numbers, and a few will chose 50%because rationally this is where it is highly possible if they are rational but i like big numbers because wining 10 pounds makes me feel putting big numbers that's how I feel, and decision is totally up to you:) take care"
3062,35,l3,belief,"i do not have a suggested decision as it is not based on any logic .. i cannot predict what theother teams will play and cannot  gure out how to work out what would be the best decision tomake.if you have any better ideas, i am willing to take your adviceif you dont have any better ideas, then i guess we will just be lucky..or not.."
3063,36,l3,belief,"the problem is that we have to be BELOW the assumed average - which is tricky cos how shouldwe know? lets think about what's going on in ppl's minds: they're all facing the same question,so i reckon they'll go for ratherso lets try being below that as well and do something like 25 or maybe even 20 which would betwo thirds of their 30-40"
3064,38,l3,belief,"I reckon most people will assume an average of 50 so go for 36 or 37 (2/3 of 50) so I suggestwe go for 2/3 of their guesses, say 25"
3065,39,l3,belief,Random.
3066,40,l3,belief,I think the result depends on others decision
3067,42,l3,belief,i dont really get it. any suggestions
3068,43,l3,belief,the average number goes toward the 50 if the participants are so many.even if the number of pariticipants is just 16but i suggest this number.
3069,44,l3,belief,"Two thirds of 75 is 50, but I think other people will choose this, as this is an easy number.I do not think other people will think of 90 straight away."
3070,45,l3,belief,"66 is two thirds, many may go for this number, for the connection."
3071,46,l3,belief,I think that the average would be 50 and 2/3 of 50 is about 32
3072,47,l3,belief,Hopefully the average should be about 50 because all the teams will choose a random numberand 35 is about 2/3 of 50
3073,48,l3,belief,i would go for something high as it is unlikely that lots of people will go for something very lowand so that means we more likely to get closer to the averagebut im not sure really! that would be my suggestion
3074,49,l3,belief,"I don't really know if there's a structure to this, so am picking a number that is close to twothirds of the half of 100."
3075,50,l3,belief,88 is the year I was born and my lucky number. So this is my suggested decision
3076,51,l3,belief,I don't understand! :-S
3077,52,l3,belief,people may just go for half of one hundred because its like half way...numbers like 67 or 34 areless likely to be chosenmaybe?
3078,69,l3,belief,57
3079,70,l3,belief,what do you think?
3080,71,l3,belief,"well i guess the average will be about 50-60, so this is roughly down to two thirds, what do yousay? :)"
3081,72,l3,belief,"I think it is more possilbe around 30, and it should be less than 50 I think."
3082,73,l3,belief,"I think there's got to be at least 8 or 9 teams, so I reckon thats got to come to at least 500 intotal, the average of which would be about 55-60, which gives 40 as two thirds of it.So I say we go for between 40 and 50"
3083,74,l3,belief,it is better to take a high number in order to have a reduced choice for the  nal decision
3084,76,l3,belief,"I think everyone will aim for a two-thirds number of less than 50, so the target number of whateveryone actually picks will be much lower! I think it'll be less than 30. As everyone will bepicking low numbers to allow for this. so i think 16"
3085,77,l3,belief,"Average should be around 50 but I can't tell if it actually will be, 2/3s of 50 is about 34. So Ithink 34 is a good startI'm going with 34"
3086,78,l3,belief,"If the answer is going to be two thirds of the average, it cannot be above 66 as this is two thirdsof 99I think most people will work that out and go for something around 50 ish, so I think 30-40 willget us in the right area"
3087,79,l3,belief,"provided that a number of people will go for answer of 2/3s of a 100 (66) then we should go forananswer that is 2/3's of that (44), however, i suggest we scale the number down slightly if otherteams dothe same as ourselves, therefore I suggest 38. I am open to your theory"
3088,80,l3,belief,i think a number around this number will possible give us the right ans as most people willchoose above 50
3089,81,l3,belief,i guess if most people assume the teams average will be 50 then they will expect (2/3) to beaprox 33 and thiss will be their guesswhich would mean our guess should be 22however if other people assume the same then (2/3) average will be more like 7want to go with somewhere in the middle...# 12?
3090,82,l3,belief,I worked on an average of 50 and then looked at two thirds and added on a bit for luck!
3091,83,l3,belief,"most people willchoose a number under 50, but not too low, so I reckon it might be somewherein the region of 26:0 not entirely certain though!"
3092,84,l3,belief,"The larger the number, the more likely we can predict the answer later."
3093,99,l3,belief,"i think that the average number will be from 50 to 60, therefore 2/3 of this will be around 32 to40. so i chose 35"
3094,100,l3,belief,"I'm assuming everyone will choose a large number.If we choose very large numbers, i.e 90 and above, it will severely increase the overall averagemaking it less likely that the overall average can be below 40, at least.Hopefully, this works in practice as well as in theory."
3095,101,l3,belief,"i think most people will pick a number around 2/3rds of 100, but if this is so, 2/3rds of 60 willbe around 40.but then again, if everyone is thinkin glike this then the average will be rougly 30, so im notsure! but im going to go with 40."
3096,102,l3,belief,"lets all pic 0!! if we pick 0 the averge is 0, our targer number is 0, and 2/3rds of 0 is 0!! wecannot lose!!!!!think about it keep it simeple. go 0!!!!"
3097,103,l3,belief,"if people are varied from 0 to 100, the target number would be around 30,That answer would be the best way to be logical because we cannot guratee all the other's numberIf you have any prefency that they would prefer big number, that will be higher than 33, on else,will be below 30"
3098,104,l3,belief,I reckon the average will be players saying 66/100 approx due to it being two thirds.I believe we should say two thirds of that number which would range between 40 and 50The lower range will probably be a wiser move as a few others will estimate lower.Personally i would be happy with anything between 38-42.
3099,105,l3,belief,Every tries to guess the two-thirds of the average.If every one choose randomly from 0 {100 then the average would be 50then the two-thirds would be about 33so I would guess 33I am a Mathematican
3100,106,l3,belief,Perhaps around 30 would be the safest bet?Because it's going to be 2/3 of the average... just an idea. i dont really have any mathimaticalcalculationsaround the suggestion.If you do.. I will follow your lead.
3101,107,l3,belief,I think that most team players will say a number under 50 because every team contributes onenumber from the average of all teams 2/3 are taken. So everyone wil think that it is most likelyto be something under 50 and even less because whatever number it is 1/3 will fall away.I think it will be 18 because the average will be around 25 to 27 because everyone tries to saysomething already thinking that it will be subtracted by 1/3
3102,108,l3,belief,"I assume that most teams will choose low initial numbers, as they will be aiming to undercutthe other teams, being closer to the 2/3 target pointBy choosing 20, i think that it will be high to be above the initial low numbers, whilst not beingso astronomically high as to rule us out entirely."
3103,109,l3,belief,"I assume hat the average of all teams will be around 40, because most people tend to choosesmaller numbers(don't know why)So, I estimate that 23 is verly likely to be the closest to 2/3, but this is just a suugestion, ofcourse"
3104,110,l3,belief,"I'm not entirely sure what sort of objective we are looking for, but as 66 is two thirds from 0 to100i suggest we choose this numberand again it's mere luck or probability which i'm not sure how to calculate."
3105,111,l3,belief,"its the highest number, and i would expect its the most common one to pick."
3106,112,l3,belief,"i just picked it because if about 50, the mid way point, is the average then 30 is about 2/3 ofthe average"
3107,113,l3,belief,"Statistically, 50 would be the average and therefore two thirs of this would be roughly 33, how-ever i think, especially in the  rst round, people will be inlined to enter high numbers. So i thinkthat two thirs of the averageIf we both put in 100 and then estiamte somwehere near 60 i think we may have a better chance.Perhaps not as high as 60 but you get my reasoning."
3108,114,l3,belief,"If we put in 100, we'll know that the average is going to be slightly higher than what it would beotherwise (as the average would probably settle at around 50) { I think a few people will havethis idea (as there's a lot2/3rds of the average will be around 50, and the actual average being 60something."
